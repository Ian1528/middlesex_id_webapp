That was to say, ever since the first tiny bloom had opened. It had called her to come and gaze on a mystery. From barren brown stems to glistening leaf-buds; from the leaf-buds to snowy virginity of bloom. It stirred her tremendously. How? Why? It was like a flute song forgotten in another existence and remembered again. What? How? Why? This singing she heard that had nothing to do with her ears. The rose of the world was breathing out smell. It followed her through all her waking moments and caressed her in her sleep. It connected itself with other vaguely felt matters that had struck her outside observation and buried themselves in her flesh. Now they emerged and quested about her consciousness.", "She was stretched on her back beneath the pear tree soaking in the alto chant of the visiting bees, the gold of the sun and the panting breath of the breeze when the inaudible voice of it all came to her.

So this was a marriage! She had been summoned to behold a revelation. Then Janie felt a pain remorseless sweet that left her limp and languid.", "After a while she got up from where she was and went over the little garden field entire.

Yes, she would love Logan after they were married. She could see no way for it to come about, but Nanny and the old folks had said it, so it must be so.

Then there is a depth of thought untouched by words, and deeper still a gulf of formless feelings untouched by thought. Nanny entered this infinity of conscious pain again on her old knees.

She knew things that nobody had ever told her. For instance, the words of the trees and the wind. She often spoke to falling seeds and said, \u201cAh hope you fall on soft ground,\u201d because she had heard seeds saying that to each other as they passed. She knew the world was a stallion rolling in the blue pasture of ether. She knew that God tore down the old world every evening and built a new one by sun- up. It was wonderful to see it take form with the sun and emerge from the gray dust of its making. The familiar people and things had failed her so she hung over the gate and looked up the road towards way off. She knew now that marriage did not make love. Janie\u2019s first dream was dead, so she became a woman.", "\nLong before the year was up, Janie noticed that her husband had stopped talking in rhymes to her.

He was very solemn and helped her to the seat beside him. With him on it, it sat like some high, ruling chair.

Mostly he talked about plans for the town when he got there. They were bound to need somebody like him. Janie took a lot of looks at him and she was proud of what she saw. Kind of portly like rich white folks. Strange trains, and people and places didn\u2019t scare him neither.

Told Janie to hold the committee there until he got back, he didn\u2019t want to miss them, but he meant to count every foot of that lumber before it touched the ground. He could have saved his breath and Janie could have kept right on with what she was doing. In the first place everybody was late in coming; then the next thing as soon as they heard where Jody was, they kept right on up there where the new lumber was rattling off the wagon and being piled under the big live oak tree.

A day was named for roads and they all agreed to bring axes and things like that and chop out two roads running each way. That applied to everybody except Tony and Coker.

Jody himself would be busy driving around from town to town telling people about Eatonville and drumming up citizens to move there.", "Janie was astonished to see the money Jody had spent for the land come back to him so fast. Ten new families bought lots and moved to town in six weeks. It all looked too big and rushing for her to keep track of. Before the store had a complete roof, Jody had canned goods piled on the floor and was selling so much he didn\u2019t have time to go off on his talking tours. She had her first taste of presiding over it the day it was complete and finished. Jody told her to dress up and stand in the store all that evening. Everybody was coming sort of fixed up, and he didn\u2019t mean for nobody else\u2019s wife to rank with her. She must look on herself as the bell-cow, the other women were the gang. So she put on one of her bought dresses and went up the new-cut road all dressed in wine-colored red. Her silken ruffles rustled and muttered about her. The other women had on percale and calico with here and there a headrag among the older ones.", "Nobody was buying anything that night. They didn\u2019t come there for that. They had come to make a welcome. So Joe knocked in the head of a barrel of soda crackers and cut some cheese.", "\u201cEverybody come right forward and make merry.

She had never thought of making a speech, and didn\u2019t know if she cared to make one at all. It must have been the way Joe spoke out without giving her a chance to say anything one way or another that took the bloom off of things. But anyway, she went down the road behind him that night feeling cold.

But the whole town got vain over it after it came. That was because the Mayor didn\u2019t just take it out of the crate and stick it up on a post. He unwrapped it and had it wiped off carefully and put it up on a showcase for a week for everybody to see. Then he set a time for the lighting and sent word all around Orange County for one and all to come to the lamplighting. He sent men out to the swamp to cut the finest and the straightest cypress post they could find, and kept on sending them back to hunt another one until they found one that pleased him. He had talked to the people already", "about the hospitality of the occasion.", "\u201cY\u2019all know we can\u2019t invite people to our town just dry long so. I god, naw.

The women got together the sweets and the men looked after the meats. The day before the lighting, they dug a big hole in back of the store and filled it full of oak wood and burned it down to a glowing bed of coals. It took them the whole night to barbecue the three hogs. Hambo and Pearson had full charge while the others helped out with turning the meat now and then while Hambo swabbed it all over with the sauce. In between times they told stories, laughed and told more stories and sung songs. They cut all sorts of capers and whiffed the meat as it slowly came to perfection with the seasoning penetrating to the bone. The younger boys had to rig up the saw-horses with boards for the women to use as tables. Then it was after sun-up and everybody not needed went home to rest up for the feast.", "By five o\u2019clock the town was full of every kind of a vehicle and swarming with people.

De Sun-maker brings it up in de mornin\u2019, and de Sun-maker sends it tuh bed at night. Us poor weak humans can\u2019t do nothin\u2019 tuh hurry it up nor to slow it down. All we can do, if we want any light after de settin\u2019 or befo\u2019 de risin\u2019, is tuh make some light ourselves. So dat\u2019s how come lamps was made.

You oughta be glad, \u2019cause dat makes uh big woman outa you.\u201d", "A feeling of coldness and fear took hold of her. She felt far away from things and lonely.", "Janie soon began to feel the impact of awe and envy against her sensibilities. The wife of the Mayor was not just another woman as she had supposed. She slept with authority and so she was part of it in the town mind. She couldn\u2019t get but so close to most of them in spirit. It was especially noticeable after Joe had forced through a town ditch to drain the street in front of the store. They had murmured hotly about slavery being over, but every man filled his assignment.", "There was something about Joe Starks that cowed the town. It was not because of physical fear. He was no fist fighter. His bulk was not even imposing as men go. Neither was it because he was more literate than the rest. Something else made men give way before him. He had a bow-down command in his face, and every step he took made the thing more tangible.", "Take for instance that new house of his. It had two stories with porches, with bannisters and such things. The rest of the town looked like servants\u2019 quarters surrounding the \u201cbig house.\u201d And different from everybody else in the town he put off moving in until it had been painted, in and out. And look at the way he painted it\u2014a gloaty, sparkly white. The kind of promenading white that the houses of Bishop Whipple, W. B. Jackson and the Vanderpool\u2019s wore. It made the village feel funny talking to him\u2014just like he was anybody else. Then there was the matter of the spittoons. No sooner was he all set as the Mayor\u2014post master\u2014landlord\u2014storekeeper,", "than he bought a desk like Mr. Hill or Mr. Galloway over in Maitland with one of those swing-around chairs to it. What with him biting down on cigars and saving his breath on talk and swinging round in that chair, it weakened people. And then he spit in that gold-looking vase that anybody else would have been glad to put on their front- room table. Said it was a spittoon just like his used-to-be bossman used to have in his bank up there in Atlanta. Didn\u2019t have to get up and go to the door every time he had to spit. Didn\u2019t spit on his floor neither. Had that golded-up spitting pot right handy. But he went further than that. He bought a little lady-size spitting pot for Janie to spit in. Had it right in the parlor with little sprigs of flowers painted all around the sides. It took people by surprise because most of the women dipped snuff and of course had a spit-cup in the house. But how could they know up-to-date folks was spitting in flowery little things like that? It sort of made the rest of them feel that they had been taken advantage of. Like things had been kept from them. Maybe more things in the world besides spitting pots had been hid from them, when they wasn\u2019t told no better than to spit in tomato cans. It was bad enough for white people, but when one of your own color could be so different it put you on a wonder. It was like seeing your sister turn into a \u2019gator. A familiar strangeness. You keep seeing your sister in the \u2019gator and the \u2019gator in your sister, and you\u2019d rather not. There was no doubt that the town respected him and even admired him in a way. But any man who walks in the way of power and property is bound to meet hate. So when speakers stood up when the occasion demanded and said \u201cOur beloved Mayor,\u201d it was one of those statements that everybody says but nobody actually believes like \u201cGod is everywhere.\u201d It was just a handle to wind up the tongue with. As time went on and the benefits he had conferred upon the town receded in time they sat on his store porch while he was busy inside and discussed him. Like one day after he caught Henry Pitts with a wagon load of his ribbon cane and took the cane away from Pitts and made him leave town. Some of them thought Starks ought not to have done that. He had so much cane and everything else. But they didn\u2019t say that while Joe", "Starks was on the porch. When the mail came from Maitland and he went inside to sort it out everybody had their say.", "Sim Jones started off as soon as he was sure that Starks couldn\u2019t hear him.", "\u201cIt\u2019s uh sin and uh shame runnin\u2019 dat po\u2019 man way from here lak dat. Colored folks oughtn\u2019t tuh be so hard on one \u2019nother.\u201d", "\u201cAh don\u2019t see it dat way atall,\u201d Sam Watson said shortly. \u201cLet colored folks learn to work for what dey git lak everybody else.

We bend which ever way he blows,\u201d Sam Watson agreed, \u201cbut at dat us needs him. De town wouldn\u2019t be nothin\u2019 if it wasn\u2019t for him. He can\u2019t help bein\u2019 sorta bossy.

They bowed down to him rather, because he was all of these things, and then again he was all of these things because the town bowed down.", "\nEvery morning the world flung itself over and exposed the town to the sun. So Janie had another day. And every day had a store in it, except Sundays. The store itself was a pleasant place if only she didn\u2019t have to sell things. When the people sat around on the porch and passed around the pictures of their thoughts for the others to look at and see, it was nice. The fact that the thought pictures were always crayon enlargements of life made it even nicer to listen to.", "Take for instance the case of Matt Bonner\u2019s yellow mule. They had him up for conversation every day the Lord sent. Most especial if Matt was there himself to listen. Sam and Lige and Walter were the ringleaders of the mule-talkers.

But that never halted the mule talk. There would be more stories about how poor the brute was; his age; his evil disposition and his latest caper. Everybody indulged in mule talk. He was next to the Mayor in prominence, and made better talking.", "Janie loved the conversation and sometimes she thought up good stories on the mule, but Joe had forbidden her to indulge.

Laughed his big heh, heh laugh too. But then when Lige or Sam or Walter or some of the other big picture talkers were using a side of the world for a canvas, Joe would hustle her off inside the store to sell something. Look like he took pleasure in doing it. Why couldn\u2019t he go himself sometimes? She had come to hate the inside of that store anyway. That Post Office too. People always coming and asking for mail at the wrong time. Just when she was trying to count up something or write in an account book. Get her so hackled she\u2019d make the wrong change for stamps. Then too, she couldn\u2019t read everybody\u2019s writing. Some folks wrote so funny and spelt things different from what she knew about. As a rule, Joe put", "up the mail himself, but sometimes when he was off she had to do it herself and it always ended up in a fuss.", "The store itself kept her with a sick headache. The labor of getting things down off of a shelf or out of a barrel was nothing. And so long as people wanted only a can of tomatoes or a pound of rice it was all right. But supposing they went on and said a pound and a half of bacon and a half pound of lard? The whole thing changed from a little walking and stretching to a mathematical dilemma. Or maybe cheese was thirty-seven cents a pound and somebody came and asked for a dime\u2019s worth. She went through many silent rebellions over things like that. Such a waste of life and time. But Joe kept saying that she could do it if she wanted to and he wanted her to use her privileges. That was the rock she was battered against.", "This business of the headrag irked her endlessly. But Jody was set on it. Her hair was NOT going to show in the store. It didn\u2019t seem sensible at all. That was because Joe never told Janie how jealous he was. He never told her how often he had seen the other men figuratively wallowing in it as she went about things in the store. And one night he had caught Walter standing behind Janie and brushing the back of his hand back and forth across the loose end of her braid ever so lightly so as to enjoy the feel of it without Janie knowing what he was doing. Joe was at the back of the store and Walter didn\u2019t see him. He felt like rushing forth with the meat knife and chopping off the offending hand. That night he ordered Janie to tie up her hair around the store. That was all. She was there in the store for him to look at, not those others. But he never said things like that.

Lum had to run for safety. Five or six more men left the porch and surrounded the fractious beast, goosing him in the sides and making him show his temper. But he had more spirit left than body. He was soon panting and heaving from the effort of spinning his old carcass about. Everybody was having fun at the mule-baiting.

The town talked it for three days and said that\u2019s just what they would have done if they had been rich men like Joe Starks. Anyhow a free-mule in town was something new to talk about. Starks piled fodder under the big tree near the porch and the mule was usually around the store like the other citizens. Nearly everybody took the habit of fetching along a handful of fodder to throw on the pile. He almost got fat and they took a great pride in him. New lies sprung up about his free-mule doings. How he pushed open Lindsay\u2019s kitchen door and slept in the place one night and fought until they made coffee for his breakfast; how he stuck his head in the Pearsons\u2019 window while the family was at the table and Mrs. Pearson mistook him for Rev. Pearson and handed him a plate; he ran Mrs. Tully off of the croquet ground for having such an ugly shape; he ran and caught up with Becky Anderson on the", "way to Maitland so as to keep his head out of the sun under her umbrella; he got tired of listening to Redmond\u2019s long-winded prayer, and went inside the Baptist church and broke up the meeting.

That wasn\u2019t natural and it didn\u2019t look right, but Sam said it would have been more unnatural for him to have laid down on his side and died like any other beast. He had seen Death coming and had stood his ground and fought it like a natural man. He had fought it to the last breath. Naturally he didn\u2019t have time to straighten himself out. Death had to take him like it found him.", "When the news got around, it was like the end of a war or something like that. Everybody that could knocked off from work to stand around and talk. But finally there was nothing to do but drag him out like all other dead brutes. Drag him out to the edge of the hammock which was far enough off to satisfy sanitary conditions in the town. The rest was up to the buzzards. Everybody was going to the dragging-out. The news had got Mayor Starks out of bed before time.

No, the carcass moved off with the town, and left Janie standing in the doorway.", "Out in the swamp they made great ceremony over the mule. They mocked everything human in death. Starks led off with a great eulogy on our departed citizen, our most distinguished citizen and the grief he left behind him, and the people loved the speech. It made him more solid than building the schoolhouse had done. He stood on the distended belly of the mule for a platform and made gestures. When he stepped down, they hoisted Sam up and he talked about the mule as a school teacher first. Then he set his hat like John Pearson and imitated his preaching. He spoke of the joys of mule-heaven to which the dear brother had departed this valley of sorrow; the mule-angels flying around; the miles of green corn and cool water, a pasture of pure bran with a river of molasses running through it; and most glorious of all, No Matt Bonner with plow lines and halters to come in and corrupt. Up there, mule- angels would have people to ride on and from his place beside the glittering throne, the dear departed brother would look down into hell and see the devil plowing Matt Bonner all day long in a hell-hot sun and laying the raw-hide to his back.", "With that the sisters got mock-happy and shouted and had to be held up by the menfolks. Everybody enjoyed themselves to the highest and then finally the mule was left to the already impatient buzzards. They were holding a great flying-meet way up over the heads of the mourners and some of the nearby trees were already peopled with the stoop-shouldered forms.", "As soon as the crowd was out of sight they closed in circles. The", "near ones got nearer and the far ones got near. A circle, a swoop and a hop with spread-out wings. Close in, close in till some of the more hungry or daring perched on the carcass. They wanted to begin, but the Parson wasn\u2019t there, so a messenger was sent to the ruler in a tree where he sat.", "The flock had to wait for the white-headed leader, but it was hard. They jostled each other and pecked at heads in hungry irritation. Some walked up and down the beast from head to tail, tail to head. The Parson sat motionless in a dead pine tree about two miles off. He had scented the matter as quickly as any of the rest, but decorum demanded that he sit oblivious until he was notified. Then he took off with ponderous flight and circled and lowered, circled and lowered until the others danced in joy and hunger at his approach.", "He finally lit on the ground and walked around the body to see if it were really dead. Peered into its nose and mouth. Examined it well from end to end and leaped upon it and bowed, and the others danced a response. That being over, he balanced and asked:", "\u201cWhat killed this man?\u201d", "The chorus answered, \u201cBare, bare fat.\u201d \u201cWhat killed this man?\u201d", "\u201cBare, bare fat.\u201d", "\u201cWhat killed this man?\u201d \u201cBare, bare fat.\u201d", "\u201cWho\u2019ll stand his funeral?\u201d \u201cWe!!!!!\u201d", "\u201cWell, all right now.\u201d", "So he picked out the eyes in the ceremonial way and the feast went on. The yaller mule was gone from the town except for the porch talk, and for the children visiting his bleaching bones now and then in the spirit of adventure.", "Joe returned to the store full of pleasure and good humor but he", "didn\u2019t want Janie to notice it because he saw that she was sullen and he resented that. She had no right to be, the way he thought things out. She wasn\u2019t even appreciative of his efforts and she had plenty cause to be. Here he was just pouring honor all over her; building a high chair for her to sit in and overlook the world and she here pouting over it! Not that he wanted anybody else, but just too many women would be glad to be in her place. He ought to box her jaws!

If nobody was there to speak of, nothing happened. But if the town was there like on Saturday night, Lige would come up with a very grave air.

Her first husband had been a coachman but \u201cstudied jury\u201d to win her. He had finally become a preacher to hold her till his death. Her second husband worked in Fohnes orange grove\u2014but tried to preach when he caught her eye. He never got any further than a class leader, but that was something to offer her.

He wanted her submission and he\u2019d keep on fighting until he felt he had it.", "So gradually, she pressed her teeth together and learned to hush. The spirit of the marriage left the bedroom and took to living in the parlor. It was there to shake hands whenever company came to visit, but it never went back inside the bedroom again. So she put", "something in there to represent the spirit like a Virgin Mary image in a church. The bed was no longer a daisy-field for her and Joe to play in. It was a place where she went and laid down when she was sleepy and tired.", "She wasn\u2019t petal-open anymore with him. She was twenty-four and seven years married when she knew. She found that out one day when he slapped her face in the kitchen. It happened over one of those dinners that chasten all women sometimes. They plan and they fix and they do, and then some kitchen-dwelling fiend slips a scorchy, soggy, tasteless mess into their pots and pans. Janie was a good cook, and Joe had looked forward to his dinner as a refuge from other things. So when the bread didn\u2019t rise, and the fish wasn\u2019t quite done at the bone, and the rice was scorched, he slapped Janie until she had a ringing sound in her ears and told her about her brains before he stalked on back to the store.", "Janie stood where he left her for unmeasured time and thought. She stood there until something fell off the shelf inside her. Then she went inside there to see what it was. It was her image of Jody tumbled down and shattered. But looking at it she saw that it never was the flesh and blood figure of her dreams. Just something she had grabbed up to drape her dreams over. In a way she turned her back upon the image where it lay and looked further. She had no more blossomy openings dusting pollen over her man, neither any glistening young fruit where the petals used to be. She found that she had a host of thoughts she had never expressed to him, and numerous emotions she had never let Jody know about. Things packed up and put away in parts of her heart where he could never find them. She was saving up feelings for some man she had never seen. She had an inside and an outside now and suddenly she knew how not to mix them.", "She bathed and put on a fresh dress and head kerchief and went on to the store before Jody had time to send for her. That was a bow to the outside of things.", "Jody was on the porch and the porch was full of Eatonville as usual at this time of the day. He was baiting Mrs. Tony Robbins as", "he always did when she came to the store. Janie could see Jody watching her out of the corner of his eye while he joked roughly with Mrs. Robbins. He wanted to be friendly with her again. His big, big laugh was as much for her as for the baiting.

Sometimes she stuck out into the future, imagining her life different from what it was. But mostly she lived between her hat and her heels, with her emotional disturbances like shade patterns in the woods\u2014come and gone with the sun. She got nothing from Jody except what money could buy, and she was giving away what she didn\u2019t value.", "Now and again she thought of a country road at sun-up and considered flight. To where?

In a way it was good because it reconciled her to things. She got so she received all things with the stolidness of the earth which soaks up urine and perfume with the same indifference.", "One day she noticed that Joe didn\u2019t sit down. He just stood in front", "of a chair and fell in it. That made her look at him all over. Joe wasn\u2019t so young as he used to be. There was already something dead about him. He didn\u2019t rear back in his knees any longer. He squatted over his ankles when he walked. That stillness at the back of his neck. His prosperous-looking belly that used to thrust out so pugnaciously and intimidate folks, sagged like a load suspended from his loins. It didn\u2019t seem to be a part of him anymore.

It was always \u201cYou oughta throw somethin\u2019 over yo\u2019 shoulders befo\u2019 you go outside. You ain\u2019t no young pullet no mo\u2019.

She saw he was hurting inside so she let it pass without talking. She just measured out a little time for him and set it aside to wait.", "It got to be terrible in the store. The more his back ached and his muscle dissolved into fat and the fat melted off his bones, the more fractious he became with Janie. Especially in the store. The more people in there the more ridicule he poured over her body to point attention away from his own. So one day Steve Mixon wanted some chewing tobacco and Janie cut it wrong. She hated that tobacco knife anyway. It worked very stiff. She fumbled with the thing and cut way away from the mark. Mixon didn\u2019t mind. He held it up for a joke to tease Janie a little.", "\u201cLooka heah, Brother Mayor, whut yo\u2019 wife done took and done.\u201d It was cut comical, so everybody laughed at it. \u201cUh woman and uh knife\u2014no kind of uh knife, don\u2019t b\u2019long tuhgether.\u201d There was some more good-natured laughter at the expense of women.", "Jody didn\u2019t laugh.

It was funny if you looked at it right quick, but it got pitiful if you thought about it awhile. It was like somebody snatched off part of a woman\u2019s clothes while she wasn\u2019t looking and the streets were crowded. Then too, Janie took the middle of the floor to talk right into Jody\u2019s face, and that was something that hadn\u2019t been done before.", "\u201cStop mixin\u2019 up mah doings wid mah looks, Jody.

Janie had robbed him of his illusion of irresistible maleness that all men cherish, which was terrible. The thing that Saul\u2019s daughter had done to David. But Janie had done worse, she had cast down his empty armor before men and they had laughed, would keep on laughing. When he paraded his possessions hereafter, they would not consider the two together. They\u2019d look with envy at the things and pity the man that owned them. When he sat in judgment it would be the same. Good-for-nothing\u2019s like Dave and Lum and Jim wouldn\u2019t change place with him. For what can excuse a man in the eyes of other men for lack of strength? Raggedy-behind squirts of sixteen and seventeen would be giving him their merciless pity out of their eyes while their mouths said something humble. There was nothing to do in life anymore. Ambition was useless. And the cruel deceit of Janie! Making all that show of humbleness and scorning him all the time! Laughing at him, and now putting the town up to do the same. Joe Starks didn\u2019t know the words for all this, but he knew the feeling. So he struck Janie with all his might and drove her from the store.", "\nAfter that night Jody moved his things and slept in a room downstairs. He didn\u2019t really hate Janie, but he wanted her to think so. He had crawled off to lick his wounds. They didn\u2019t talk too much around the store either. Anybody that didn\u2019t know would have thought that things had blown over, it looked so quiet and peaceful around. But the stillness was the sleep of swords. So new thoughts had to be thought and new words said. She didn\u2019t want to live like that. Why must Joe be so mad with her for making him look small when he did it to her all the time? Had been doing it for years. Well, if she must eat out of a long-handled spoon, she must. Jody might get over his mad spell any time at all and begin to act like somebody towards her.", "Then too she noticed how baggy Joe was getting all over. Like bags hanging from an ironing board. A little sack hung from the corners of his eyes and rested on his cheek-bones; a loose-filled bag of feathers hung from his ears and rested on his neck beneath his chin. A sack of flabby something hung from his loins and rested on his thighs when he sat down. But even these things were running down like candle grease as time moved on.", "He made new alliances too. People he never bothered with one way or another now seemed to have his ear. He had always been scornful of root-doctors and all their kind, but now she saw a faker from over around Altamonte Springs, hanging around the place almost daily. Always talking in low tones when she came near, or hushed altogether. She didn\u2019t know that he was driven by a desperate hope to appear the old-time body in her sight. She was sorry about the root-doctor because she feared that Joe was depending on the scoundrel to make him well when what he needed was a doctor, and a good one. She was worried about his not eating his meals, till she found out he was having old lady Davis to cook for him.

People who never had known what it was to enter the gate of the Mayor\u2019s yard unless it were to do some menial job now paraded in and out as his confidants. They came to the store and ostentatiously looked over whatever she was doing and went back to report to him at the house.

He stands in his high house that overlooks the world. Stands watchful and motionless all day with his sword drawn back, waiting for the messenger to bid him come.

He\u2019d be all right just as soon as the two-headed man found what had been buried against him. He wasn\u2019t going to die at all. That was what he thought.

But she sat a long time with the walls creeping in on her. Four walls squeezing her breath out. Fear lest he depart while she sat trembling upstairs nerved her and she was inside the room before she caught her breath. She didn\u2019t make the cheerful, casual start that she had thought out. Something stood like an oxen\u2019s foot on her tongue, and then too, Jody, no Joe, gave her a ferocious look. A look with all the unthinkable coldness of outer space. She must talk to a man who was ten immensities away. He was lying on his side facing the door like he was expecting somebody or something. A sort of changing look on his face. Weak- looking but sharp-pointed about the eyes.

Maybe if she had known some other way to try, she might have made his face different. But what that other way could be, she had no idea. She thought back and forth about what had happened in the making of a voice out of a man. Then thought about herself. Years ago, she had told her girl self to wait for her in the looking glass. It had been a long time since she had remembered. Perhaps she\u2019d better look. She went over to the dresser and looked hard at her skin and features. The young girl was gone, but a handsome woman had taken her place. She tore off the kerchief from her head and let down her plentiful hair. The weight, the length, the glory was there. She took careful stock of herself, then combed her hair and tied it back up again. Then she starched and ironed her face, forming it into just what people wanted to see, and opened up the window and cried, \u201cCome heah people! Jody is dead. Mah husband is gone from me.\u201d", "\nJoe\u2019s funeral was the finest thing Orange County had ever seen with Negro eyes. The motor hearse, the Cadillac and Buick carriages; Dr. Henderson there in his Lincoln; the hosts from far and wide. Then again the gold and red and purple, the gloat and glamor of the secret orders, each with its insinuations of power and glory undreamed of by the uninitiated. People on farm horses and mules; babies riding astride of brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 backs. The Elks band ranked at the church door and playing \u201cSafe in the Arms of Jesus\u201d with such a dominant drum rhythm that it could be stepped off smartly by the long line as it filed inside. The Little Emperor of the cross-roads was leaving Orange County as he had come\u2014with the out-stretched hand of power.", "Janie starched and ironed her face and came set in the funeral behind her veil. It was like a wall of stone and steel. The funeral was going on outside. All things concerning death and burial were said and done. Finish. End. Nevermore. Darkness. Deep hole. Dissolution. Eternity. Weeping and wailing outside. Inside the expensive black folds were resurrection and life. She did not reach outside for anything, nor did the things of death reach inside to disturb her calm. She sent her face to Joe\u2019s funeral, and herself went rollicking with the springtime across the world. After a while the people finished their celebration and Janie went on home.", "Before she slept that night she burnt up every one of her head rags and went about the house next morning with her hair in one thick braid swinging well below her waist. That was the only change people saw in her. She kept the store in the same way except of evenings she sat on the porch and listened and sent Hezekiah in to wait on late custom. She saw no reason to rush at changing things around. She would have the rest of her life to do as she pleased.", "Most of the day she was at the store, but at night she was there in the big house and sometimes it creaked and cried all night under", "the weight of lonesomeness. Then she\u2019d lie awake in bed asking lonesomeness some questions. She asked if she wanted to leave and go back where she had come from and try to find her mother. Maybe tend her grandmother\u2019s grave. Sort of look over the old stamping ground generally. Digging around inside of herself like that she found that she had no interest in that seldom-seen mother at all. She hated her grandmother and had hidden it from herself all these years under a cloak of pity. She had been getting ready for her great journey to the horizons in search of people; it was important to all the world that she should find them and they find her. But she had been whipped like a cur dog, and run off down a back road after things. It was all according to the way you see things. Some people could look at a mud-puddle and see an ocean with ships. But Nanny belonged to that other kind that loved to deal in scraps. Here Nanny had taken the biggest thing God ever made, the horizon\u2014for no matter how far a person can go the horizon is still way beyond you\u2014and pinched it in to such a little bit of a thing that she could tie it about her granddaughter\u2019s neck tight enough to choke her. She hated the old woman who had twisted her so in the name of love. Most humans didn\u2019t love one another nohow, and this mislove was so strong that even common blood couldn\u2019t overcome it all the time. She had found a jewel down inside herself and she had wanted to walk where people could see her and gleam it around. But she had been set in the market-place to sell. Been set for still-bait. When God had made The Man, he made him out of stuff that sung all the time and glittered all over. Then after that some angels got jealous and chopped him into millions of pieces, but still he glittered and hummed. So they beat him down to nothing but sparks but each little spark had a shine and a song. So they covered each one over with mud. And the lonesomeness in the sparks make them hunt for one another, but the mud is deaf and dumb. Like all the other tumbling mud-balls, Janie had tried to show her shine.", "Janie found out very soon that her widowhood and property was a great challenge in South Florida.

Lemme know when dat ole pee-de-bed is gone and Ah\u2019ll be right back.\u201d", "Six months of wearing black passed and not one suitor had ever gained the house porch. Janie talked and laughed in the store at times, but never seemed to want to go further. She was happy except for the store. She knew by her head that she was absolute owner, but it always seemed to her that she was still clerking for Joe and that soon he would come in and find something wrong that she had done. She almost apologized to the tenants the first time she collected the rents. Felt like a usurper. But she hid that feeling by sending Hezekiah who was the best imitation of Joe that his seventeen years could make. He had even taken to smoking, and smoking cigars, since Joe\u2019s death and tried to bite \u2019em tight in one side of his mouth like Joe. Every chance he got he was reared back in Joe\u2019s swivel chair trying to thrust out his lean belly into a paunch. She\u2019d laugh quietly at his no-harm posing and pretend she didn\u2019t see it. One day as she came in the back door of the store she heard him bawling at Tripp Crawford, \u201cNaw indeed, we can\u2019t do nothin\u2019 uh de kind! I god, you ain\u2019t paid for dem last rations you done et up. I god, you won\u2019t git no mo\u2019 outa dis store than you got money tuh pay for. I god, dis ain\u2019t Gimme, Florida, dis is Eatonville.\u201d Another time she overheard him using Joe\u2019s favorite expression for pointing out the differences between himself and the careless-living, mouthy town. \u201cAh\u2019m an educated man, Ah keep mah arrangements in mah hands.\u201d She laughed outright at that. His acting didn\u2019t hurt nobody and she wouldn\u2019t know what to do without him. He sensed that and came to treat her like baby-sister, as if to say \u201cYou poor little thing, give it to big brother. He\u2019ll fix it for you.\u201d His sense of ownership made him honest too, except for an occasional jaw-breaker, or a packet of sen- sen. The sen-sen was to let on to the other boys and the pullet-size girls that he had a liquor breath to cover. This business of managing stores and women store-owners was trying on a man\u2019s nerves. He needed a drink of liquor now and then to keep up.", "When Janie emerged into her mourning white, she had hosts of admirers in and out of town. Everything open and frank. Men of property too among the crowd, but nobody seemed to get any further than the store. She was always too busy to take them to the house to entertain. They were all so respectful and stiff with her, that she might have been the Empress of Japan. They felt that it was not fitting to mention desire to the widow of Joseph Starks. You spoke of honor and respect. And all that they said and did was refracted by her inattention and shot off towards the rim-bones of nothing. She and Pheoby Watson visited back and forth and once in awhile sat around the lakes and fished. She was just basking in freedom for the most part without the need for thought. A Sanford undertaker was pressing his cause through Pheoby, and Janie was listening pleasantly but undisturbed. It might be nice to marry him, at that. No hurry. Such things take time to think about, or rather she pretended to Pheoby that that was what she was doing.", "\u201c \u2019Tain\u2019t dat Ah worries over Joe\u2019s death, Pheoby. Ah jus\u2019 loves dis freedom.\u201d", "\u201cSh-sh-sh! Don\u2019t let nobody hear you say dat, Janie.

She could close up the store herself this once. He cautioned her about the catches on the windows and doors and swaggered off to Winter Park.", "Business was dull all day, because numbers of people had gone to the game. She decided to close early, because it was hardly worth the trouble of keeping open on an afternoon like this. She had set six o\u2019clock as her limit.", "At five-thirty a tall man came into the place. Janie was leaning on the counter making aimless pencil marks on a piece of wrapping paper.

The lean, over-padded shoulders and narrow waist. Even nice!", "He was jumping her king! She screamed in protest against losing the king she had had such a hard time acquiring.

In the first place he looked too young for her. Must be around twenty-five and here she was around forty. Then again he didn\u2019t look like he had too much. Maybe he was hanging around to get in with her and strip her of all that she had. Just as well if she never saw him again. He was probably the kind of man who lived with various women but never married. Fact is, she decided to treat him so cold if he ever did foot the place that he\u2019d be sure not to come hanging around there again. He waited a week exactly to come back for Janie\u2019s snub. It was early in the afternoon and she and Hezekiah were alone. She heard somebody humming like they were feeling for pitch and looked towards the door. Tea Cake stood there mimicking the tuning of a guitar. He frowned and struggled with the pegs of his imaginary instrument watching her out of the corner of his eye with that secret joke playing over his face.

She even ridiculed him in her mind and was a little ashamed of the association. But every hour or two the battle had to be fought all over again. She couldn\u2019t make him look just like any other man to her. He looked like the love thoughts of women. He could be a bee to a blossom\u2014a pear tree blossom in the spring. He seemed to be crushing scent out of the world with his footsteps. Crushing aromatic herbs with every step he took. Spices hung about him. He was a glance from God.", "So he didn\u2019t come that night and she laid in bed and pretended to think scornfully of him. \u201cBet he\u2019s hangin\u2019 round some jook or \u2019nother.

He wanted her to get her rest. He made her stay where she was. In her heart she wanted to get his breakfast for him. But she stayed in bed long after he was gone.", "So much had been breathed out by the pores that Tea Cake still was there. She could feel him and almost see him bucking around the room in the upper air. After a long time of passive happiness, she got up and opened the window and let Tea Cake leap forth and mount to the sky on a wind. That was the beginning of things.", "In the cool of the afternoon the fiend from hell specially sent to lovers arrived at Janie\u2019s ear. Doubt. All the fears that circumstance could provide and the heart feel, attacked her on every side. This was a new sensation for her, but no less excruciating. If only Tea Cake would make her certain!

He had worked in the railroad shops up there before and his old boss had promised him a job come next pay day. No need for Janie to wait any longer. Wear the new blue dress because he meant to marry her right from the train. Hurry up and come because he was about to turn into pure sugar thinking about her. Come on, baby, papa Tea Cake never could be mad with you!", "Janie\u2019s train left too early in the day for the town to witness much, but the few who saw her leave bore plenty witness. They had to give it to her, she sho looked good, but she had no business to do it. It was hard to love a woman that always made you feel so wishful.", "The train beat on itself and danced on the shiny steel rails mile after mile. Every now and then the engineer would play on his whistle for the people in the towns he passed by. And the train shuffled on to Jacksonville, and to a whole lot of things she wanted to see and to know.", "And there was Tea Cake in the big old station in a new blue suit and straw hat, hauling her off to a preacher\u2019s house first thing. Then right on to the room he had been sleeping in for two weeks all by himself waiting for her to come. And such another hugging and kissing and carrying on you never saw. It made her so glad she was scared of herself. They stayed at home and rested that night, but the next night they went to a show and after that they rode around on the trolley cars and sort of looked things over for themselves. Tea Cake was spending and doing out of his own pocket, so Janie never told him about the two hundred dollars she had pinned inside her shirt next to her skin. Pheoby had insisted that she bring it along and keep it secret just to be on the safe side. She had ten dollars over her fare in her pocket book. Let Tea Cake think that was all she had. Things might not turn out like she thought. Every minute since she had stepped off the train she had been laughing at Pheoby\u2019s advice.", "She meant to tell Tea Cake the joke some time when she was sure she wouldn\u2019t hurt his feelings. So it came around that she had been married a week and sent Pheoby a card with a picture on it.", "That morning Tea Cake got up earlier than Janie did. She felt sleepy and told him to go get some fish to fry for breakfast. By the time he had gone and come back she would have finished her nap out. He told her he would and she turned over and went back to sleep. She woke up and Tea Cake still wasn\u2019t there and the clock said it was getting late, so she got up and washed her face and hands. Perhaps he was down in the kitchen fixing around to let her sleep. Janie went down and the landlady made her drink some coffee with her because she said her husband was dead and it was bad to be having your morning coffee by yourself.", "\u201cYo\u2019 husband gone tuh work dis mornin\u2019, Mis\u2019 Woods? Ah seen him go out uh good while uh go. Me and you kin be comp\u2019ny for one \u2019nother, can\u2019t us?\u201d", "\u201cOh yes, indeed, Mis\u2019 Samuels. You puts me in de mind uh mah friend back in Eatonville. Yeah, you\u2019se nice and friendly jus\u2019 lak her.\u201d", "Therefore Janie drank her coffee and sankled on back to her room without asking her landlady anything. Tea Cake must be hunting all over the city for that fish. She kept that thought in front of her in order not to think too much. When she heard the twelve o\u2019clock whistle she decided to get up and dress. That was when she found out her two hundred dollars was gone. There was the little cloth purse with the safety pin on the chair beneath her clothes and the money just wasn\u2019t nowhere in the room. She knew from the beginning that the money wasn\u2019t any place she knew of if it wasn\u2019t in that little pocket book pinned to her pink silk vest. But the exercise of searching the room kept her busy and that was good for her to keep moving, even though she wasn\u2019t doing anything but turning around in her tracks.", "But, don\u2019t care how firm your determination is, you can\u2019t keep turning round in one place like a horse grinding sugar cane. So Janie took to sitting over the room. Sit and look. The room inside looked like the mouth of an alligator\u2014gaped wide open to swallow", "something down. Outside the window Jacksonville looked like it needed a fence around it to keep it from running out on ether\u2019s bosom. It was too big to be warm, let alone to need somebody like her. All day and night she worried time like a bone.", "Way late in the morning the thought of Annie Tyler and Who Flung came to pay her a visit. Annie Tyler who at fifty-two had been left a widow with a good home and insurance money.", "Mrs. Tyler with her dyed hair, newly straightened and her uncomfortable new false teeth, her leathery skin, blotchy with powder and her giggle. Her love affairs, affairs with boys in their late teens or early twenties for all of whom she spent her money on suits of clothes, shoes, watches and things like that and how they all left her as soon as their wants were satisfied. Then when her ready cash was gone, had come Who Flung to denounce his predecessor as a scoundrel and took up around the house himself. It was he who persuaded her to sell her house and come to Tampa with him. The town had seen her limp off. The undersized high-heel slippers were punishing her tired feet that looked like bunions all over. Her body squeezed and crowded into a tight corset that shoved her middle up under her chin. But she had gone off laughing and sure. As sure as Janie had been.", "Then two weeks later the porter and conductor of the north bound local had helped her off the train at Maitland. Hair all gray and black and bluish and reddish in streaks. All the capers that cheap dye could cut was showing in her hair. Those slippers bent and griped just like her work-worn feet. The corset gone and the shaking old woman hanging all over herself. Everything that you could see was hanging. Her chin hung from her ears and rippled down her neck like drapes. Her hanging bosom and stomach and buttocks and legs that draped down over her ankles. She groaned but never giggled.", "She was broken and her pride was gone, so she told those who asked what had happened. Who Flung had taken her to a shabby room in a shabby house in a shabby street and promised to marry her next day. They stayed in the room two whole days then she woke", "up to find Who Flung and her money gone. She got up to stir around and see if she could find him, and found herself too worn out to do much. All she found out was that she was too old a vessel for new wine. The next day hunger had driven her out to shift. She had stood on the streets and smiled and smiled, and then smiled and begged and then just begged. After a week of world-bruising a young man from home had come along and seen her. She couldn\u2019t tell him how it was. She just told him she got off the train and somebody had stolen her purse. Naturally, he had believed her and taken her home with him to give her time to rest up a day or two, then he had bought her a ticket for home.", "They put her to bed and sent for her married daughter from up around Ocala to come see about her. The daughter came as soon as she could and took Annie Tyler away to die in peace. She had waited all her life for something, and it had killed her when it found her.", "The thing made itself into pictures and hung around Janie\u2019s bedside all night long. Anyhow, she wasn\u2019t going back to Eatonville to be laughed at and pitied. She had ten dollars in her pocket and twelve hundred in the bank. But oh God, don\u2019t let Tea Cake be off somewhere hurt and Ah not know nothing about it. And God, please suh, don\u2019t let him love nobody else but me. Maybe Ah\u2019m is uh fool, Lawd, lak dey say, but Lawd, Ah been so lonesome, and Ah been waitin\u2019, Jesus. Ah done waited uh long time.", "Janie dozed off to sleep but she woke up in time to see the sun sending up spies ahead of him to mark out the road through the dark. He peeped up over the door sill of the world and made a little foolishness with red. But pretty soon, he laid all that aside and went about his business dressed all in white. But it was always going to be dark to Janie if Tea Cake didn\u2019t soon come back. She got out of the bed but a chair couldn\u2019t hold her. She dwindled down on the floor with her head in a rocking chair.", "After a while there was somebody playing a guitar outside her door. Played right smart while. It sounded lovely too. But it was sad to hear it feeling blue like Janie was. Then whoever it was started to", "singing \u201cRing de bells of mercy. Call de sinner man home.\u201d Her heart all but smothered her.", "\u201cTea Cake, is dat you?\u201d", "\u201cYou know so well it\u2019s me, Janie. How come you don\u2019t open de door?\u201d", "But he never waited. He walked on in with a guitar and a grin.

Ah don\u2019t blame yuh but it wasn\u2019t lak you think. De girl baby ain\u2019t born and her mama is dead, dat can git me tuh spend our money on her.

Then she", "announced to the same audience, \u201cMis\u2019 Woods got herself uh new lil boy rooster, but he been off somewhere and won\u2019t tell her.\u201d", "\u201cFirst thing, though, us got tuh eat together, Janie.

He took it up and looked at it out of curiosity and put it in his pocket to count it while he was out to find some fish to fry. When he found out how much it was, he was excited and felt like letting folks know who he was. Before he found the fish market he met a fellow he used to work with at the round house. One word brought on another one and pretty soon he made up his mind to spend some of it. He never had had his hand on so much money before in his life, so he made up his mind to see how it felt to be a millionaire. They went on out to Callahan round the railroad shops and he decided to give a big chicken and macaroni supper that night, free to all.", "He bought up the stuff and they found somebody to pick the guitar so they could all dance some. So they sent the message all around for people to come. And come they did. A big table loaded down with fried chicken and biscuits and a wash-tub full of macaroni with plenty cheese in it. When the fellow began to pick the box the people begin to come from east, west, north and Australia. And he stood in the door and paid all the ugly women two dollars not to come in. One big meriny colored woman was so ugly till it was worth five dollars for her not to come in, so he gave it to her.", "They had a big time till one man come in who thought he was bad. He tried to pull and haul over all the chickens and pick out the livers and gizzards to eat. Nobody else couldn\u2019t pacify him so they called", "Tea Cake to come see if he could stop him. So Tea Cake walked up and asked him, \u201cSay, whut\u2019s de matter wid you, nohow?\u201d", "\u201cAh don\u2019t want nobody handin\u2019 me nothin\u2019. Specially don\u2019t issue me out no rations. Ah always chooses mah rations.\u201d He kept right on plowing through the pile uh chicken. So Tea Cake got mad.", "\u201cYou got mo\u2019 nerve than uh brass monkey. Tell me, what post office did you ever pee in? Ah craves tuh know.\u201d", "\u201cWhut you mean by dat now?\u201d the fellow asked.", "\u201cAh means dis\u2014it takes jus\u2019 as much nerve tuh cut caper lak dat in uh United States Government Post Office as it do tuh comes pullin\u2019 and haulin\u2019 over any chicken Ah pay for.

Tea Cake knocked out two of his teeth, so that man went on off from there. Then two men tried to pick a fight with one another, so Tea Cake said they had to kiss and make up. They didn\u2019t want to do it. They\u2019d rather go to jail, but everybody else liked the idea, so they made \u2019em do it. Afterwards, both of them spit and gagged and wiped their mouths with the back of their hands. One went outside and chewed a little grass like a sick dog, he said to keep it from killing him.", "Then everybody began to holler at the music because the man couldn\u2019t play but three pieces. So Tea Cake took the guitar and played himself. He was glad of the chance because he hadn\u2019t had his hand on a box since he put his in the pawn shop to get some money to hire a car for Janie soon after he met her. He missed his music. So that put him in the notion he ought to have one. He bought the guitar on the spot and paid fifteen dollars cash. It was really worth sixty-five any day.", "Just before day the party wore out. So Tea Cake hurried on back to his new wife. He had done found out how rich people feel and he had a fine guitar and twelve dollars left in his pocket and all he needed now was a great big old hug and kiss from Janie.", "\u201cYou musta thought yo\u2019 wife was powerful ugly.

Then he\u2019d take his deck of cards and shuffle and cut, shuffle and cut and deal out then examine each hand carefully, and do it again. So Saturday came. He went out and bought a new switch- blade knife and two decks of star-back playing cards that morning and left Janie around noon.", "\u201cThey\u2019ll start to paying off, pretty soon now.

So she got up and sat around scared and miserable. Thinking and fearing all sorts of dangers. Wondering at herself as she had many times this week that she was not shocked at Tea Cake\u2019s gambling. It was part of him, so it was all right. She rather found herself angry at imaginary people who might try to criticize. Let the old hypocrites learn to mind their own business, and leave other folks alone. Tea Cake wasn\u2019t doing a bit more harm trying to win hisself a little money than they was always doing with their lying tongues. Tea Cake had more good nature under his toe- nails than they had in their so-called Christian hearts. She better not hear none of them old backbiters talking about her husband! Please, Jesus, don\u2019t let them nasty niggers hurt her boy. If they do, Master Jesus, grant her a good gun and a chance to shoot \u2019em. Tea Cake had a knife it was true, but that was only to protect hisself. God knows, Tea Cake wouldn\u2019t harm a fly.", "Daylight was creeping around the cracks of the world when Janie heard a feeble rap on the door. She sprung to the door and flung", "it wide. Tea Cake was out there looking like he was asleep standing up. In some strange way it was frightening. Janie caught his arm to arouse him and he stumbled into the room and fell.", "\u201cTea Cake! You chile! What\u2019s de matter, honey?\u201d", "\u201cDey cut me, dat\u2019s all. Don\u2019t cry.

He told her not to call a doctor unless he got much worse. It was mostly loss of blood anyhow.", "\u201cAh won the money jus\u2019 lak Ah told yuh.

Weeds that did well to grow waist high up the state were eight and often ten feet tall down there. Ground so rich that everything went wild. Volunteer cane just taking the place. Dirt roads so rich and black that a half mile of it would have fertilized a Kansas wheat field. Wild cane on either side of the road hiding the rest of the world.

Less go!\u201d", "They rattled nine miles in a borrowed car to the quarters that squatted so close that only the dyke separated them from great, sprawling Okechobee. Janie fussed around the shack making a home while Tea Cake planted beans. After hours they fished. Every now and then they\u2019d run across a party of Indians in their long, narrow dug-outs calmly winning their living in the trackless ways of the \u2019Glades. Finally the beans were in. Nothing much to do but wait to pick them. Tea Cake picked his box a great deal for Janie, but he still didn\u2019t have enough to do. No need of gambling yet. The people who were pouring in were broke. They didn\u2019t come bringing money, they were coming to make some.", "\u201cTell yuh whut, Janie, less buy us some shootin\u2019 tools and go huntin\u2019 round heah.\u201d", "\u201cDat would be fine, Tea Cake, exceptin\u2019 you know Ah can\u2019t shoot.

Tea Cake made her shoot at little things just to give her good aim. Pistol and shot gun and rifle. It got so the others stood around and watched them. Some of the men would beg for a shot at the target themselves. It was the most exciting thing on the muck. Better than the jook and the pool-room unless some special band was playing for a dance. And the thing that got everybody was the way Janie caught on. She got to the place she could shoot a hawk out of a pine tree and not tear him up. Shoot his head off. She got to be a better shot than Tea Cake. They\u2019d go out any late afternoon and come back loaded down with game. One night they got a boat and went out hunting alligators. Shining their phosphorescent eyes and shooting them in the dark. They could sell the hides and teeth in Palm Beach besides having fun together till work got pressing.", "Day by day now, the hordes of workers poured in. Some came limping in with their shoes and sore feet from walking. It\u2019s hard trying to follow your shoe instead of your shoe following you. They came in wagons from way up in Georgia and they came in truck loads from east, west, north and south. Permanent transients with no attachments and tired looking men with their families and dogs in flivvers. All night, all day, hurrying in to pick beans. Skillets, beds, patched up spare inner tubes all hanging and dangling from the ancient cars on the outside and hopeful humanity, herded and hovered on the inside, chugging on to the muck. People ugly from ignorance and broken from being poor.", "All night now the jooks clanged and clamored. Pianos living three lifetimes in one. Blues made and used right on the spot. Dancing, fighting, singing, crying, laughing, winning and losing love every hour. Work all day for money, fight all night for love.

But they had to pay the man whose land they slept on. He ran the fire just like his boarding place\u2014for pay. But nobody cared. They made good money, even to the children. So they spent good money. Next month and next year were other times. No need to mix them up with the present.", "Tea Cake\u2019s house was a magnet, the unauthorized center of the \u201cjob.\u201d The way he would sit in the doorway and play his guitar made people stop and listen and maybe disappoint the jook for that night.

Sometimes baked big pans of navy beans with plenty of sugar and hunks of bacon laying on top. That was something Tea Cake loved so no matter if Janie had fixed beans two or three times during the week, they had baked beans again on Sunday. She always had some kind of dessert too, as Tea Cake said it give a man something to taper off on. Sometimes she\u2019d straighten out the two-room house and take the rifle and have fried rabbit for supper when Tea Cake", "got home. She didn\u2019t leave him itching and scratching in his work clothes, either. The kettle of hot water was already waiting when he got in.", "Then Tea Cake took to popping in at the kitchen door at odd hours. Between breakfast and dinner, sometimes. Then often around two o\u2019clock he\u2019d come home and tease and wrestle with her for a half hour and slip on back to work. So one day she asked him about it.", "\u201cTea Cake, whut you doin\u2019 back in de quarters when everybody else is still workin\u2019?\u201d", "\u201cCome tuh see \u2019bout you.

But since you got dat in yo\u2019 head, Ah\u2019ll have tuh tell yuh de real truth, so yuh can know. Janie, Ah gits lonesome out dere all day \u2019thout yuh.

It\u2019s near \u2019bout all day.\u201d", "So the very next morning Janie got ready to pick beans along with Tea Cake. There was a suppressed murmur when she picked up a basket and went to work. She was already getting to be a special case on the muck. It was generally assumed that she thought herself too good to work like the rest of the women and that Tea Cake \u201cpomped her up tuh dat.\u201d But all day long the romping and playing they carried on behind the boss\u2019s back made her popular right away. It got the whole field to playing off and on. Then Tea Cake would help get supper afterwards.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t think Ah\u2019m tryin\u2019 tuh git outa takin\u2019 keer uh yuh, do yuh, Janie, \u2019cause Ah ast yuh tuh work long side uh me?\u201d Tea Cake asked her at the end of her first week in the field.", "\u201cAh naw, honey.

That is, all around the doorstep was full. Some were there to hear Tea Cake pick the box; some came to talk and tell stories, but most of them came to get into whatever game was going on or might go on. Sometimes Tea Cake lost heavily, for there were several good gamblers on the lake. Sometimes he won and made Janie proud of his skill. But outside of the two jooks, everything on that job went on around those two.", "Sometimes Janie would think of the old days in the big white house and the store and laugh to herself. What if Eatonville could see her now in her blue denim overalls and heavy shoes? The crowd of people around her and a dice game on her floor! She was sorry for her friends back there and scornful of the others. The men held big arguments here like they used to do on the store porch. Only here, she could listen and laugh and even talk some herself if she wanted to. She got so she could tell big stories herself from listening to the rest. Because she loved to hear it, and the men loved to hear themselves, they would \u201cwoof\u201d and \u201cboogerboo\u201d around the games to the limit. No matter how rough it was, people seldom got mad, because everything was done for a laugh. Everybody loved to hear Ed Dockery, Bootyny, and Sop-de-Bottom in a skin game. Ed Dockery was dealing one night and he looked over at Sop-de- Bottom\u2019s card and he could tell Sop thought he was going to win. He hollered, \u201cAh\u2019ll break up dat settin\u2019 uh eggs.\u201d Sop looked and said, \u201cRoot de peg.\u201d Bootyny asked, \u201cWhat are you goin\u2019 tuh do? Do do!\u201d Everybody was watching that next card fall. Ed got ready to turn. \u201cAh\u2019m gointuh sweep out hell and burn up de broom.\u201d He slammed down another dollar. \u201cDon\u2019t oversport yourself, Ed,\u201d Bootyny challenged. \u201cYou gittin\u2019 too yaller.\u201d Ed caught hold of the corner of the card. Sop dropped a dollar. \u201cAh\u2019m gointuh shoot in de hearse, don\u2019t keer how sad de funeral be.\u201d Ed said, \u201cYou see how this man is teasin\u2019 hell?\u201d Tea Cake nudged Sop not to bet. \u201cYou gointuh git caught in uh bullet storm if you don\u2019t watch out.\u201d Sop said, \u201cAw \u2019tain\u2019t nothin\u2019 tuh dat bear but his curly hair.

You can\u2019t do no business.\u201d Nobody fell on that card. Everybody was scared of the next one. Ed looked around and saw Gabe standing behind his chair and hollered, \u201cMove, from over me, Gabe! You too black. You draw heat! Sop, you wanta pick up dat bet whilst you got uh chance?\u201d \u201cNaw, man, Ah wish Ah had uh thousand-leg tuh put on it.\u201d \u201cSo yuh won\u2019t lissen, huh? Dumb niggers and free schools. Ah\u2019m gointuh take and teach yuh. Ah\u2019ll main-line but Ah won\u2019t side-track.\u201d Ed flipped the next card and Sop fell and lost. Everybody hollered and laughed. Ed laughed and said, \u201cGit off de muck! You ain\u2019t nothin\u2019. Dat\u2019s all! Hot boilin\u2019 water won\u2019t help yuh none.\u201d Ed kept on laughing because he had been so scared before. \u201cSop, Bootyny, all y\u2019all dat lemme win yo\u2019 money: Ah\u2019m sending it straight off to Sears and Roebuck and buy me some clothes, and when Ah turn out Christmas day, it would take a doctor to tell me how near Ah is dressed tuh death.\u201d", "\nJanie learned what it felt like to be jealous. A little chunky girl took to picking a play out of Tea Cake in the fields and in the quarters. If he said anything at all, she\u2019d take the opposite side and hit him or shove him and run away to make him chase her. Janie knew what she was up to\u2014luring him away from the crowd. It kept up for two or three weeks with Nunkie getting bolder all the time. She\u2019d hit Tea Cake playfully and the minute he so much as tapped her with his finger she\u2019d fall against him or fall on the ground and have to be picked up. She\u2019d be almost helpless. It took a good deal of handling to set her on her feet again. And another thing, Tea Cake didn\u2019t seem to be able to fend her off as promptly as Janie thought he ought to. She began to be snappish a little. A little seed of fear was growing into a tree. Maybe some day Tea Cake would weaken. Maybe he had already given secret encouragement and this was Nunkie\u2019s way of bragging about it. Other people began to notice too, and that put Janie more on a wonder.", "One day they were working near where the beans ended and the sugar cane began. Janie had marched off a little from Tea Cake\u2019s side with another woman for a chat. When she glanced around Tea Cake was gone. Nunkie too. She knew because she looked.", "\u201cWhere\u2019s Tea Cake?\u201d she asked Sop-de-Bottom.", "He waved his hand towards the cane field and hurried away. Janie never thought at all. She just acted on feelings. She rushed into the cane and about the fifth row down she found Tea Cake and Nunkie struggling. She was on them before either knew.", "\u201cWhut\u2019s de matter heah?\u201d Janie asked in a cold rage. They sprang apart.", "\u201cNothing\u2019,\u201d Tea Cake told her, standing shame-faced.", "\u201cWell, whut you doin\u2019 in heah?

So she took out behind her over the humped-up cane rows. But Nunkie did not mean to be caught. So Janie went on home. The sight of the fields and the other happy people was too much for her that day. She walked slowly and thoughtfully to the quarters. It wasn\u2019t long before Tea Cake found her there and tried to talk. She cut him short with a blow and they fought from one room to the other, Janie trying to beat him, and Tea Cake kept holding her wrists and wherever he could to keep her from going too far.", "\u201cAh b\u2019lieve you been messin\u2019 round her!\u201d she panted furiously. \u201cNo sich uh thing!\u201d Tea Cake retorted.", "\u201cAh b\u2019lieve yuh did.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t keer how big uh lie get told, somebody kin b\u2019lieve it!\u201d", "They fought on. \u201cYou done hurt mah heart, now you come wid uh lie tuh bruise mah ears! Turn go mah hands!\u201d Janie seethed. But Tea Cake never let go. They wrestled on until they were doped with their own fumes and emanations; till their clothes had been torn away; till he hurled her to the floor and held her there melting her resistance with the heat of his body, doing things with their bodies to express the inexpressible; kissed her until she arched her body to meet him and they fell asleep in sweet exhaustion.", "The next morning Janie asked like a woman, \u201cYou still love ole Nunkie?\u201d", "\u201cNaw, never did, and you know it too. Ah didn\u2019t want her.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d She didn\u2019t say this because she believed it. She wanted to hear his denial. She had to crow over the fallen Nunkie.", "\u201cWhut would Ah do wid dat lil chunk of a woman wid you around?

Tea Cake and Janie decided to stay since they wanted to make another season on the muck. There was nothing to do, after they had gathered several bushels of dried beans to save over and sell to the planters in the fall. So Janie began to look around and see people and things she hadn\u2019t noticed during the season.", "For instance during the summer when she heard the subtle but compelling rhythms of the Bahaman drummers, she\u2019d walk over and watch the dances. She did not laugh the \u201cSaws\u201d to scorn as she had heard the people doing in the season. She got to like it a lot and she and Tea Cake were on hand every night till the others teased them about it.", "Janie came to know Mrs. Turner now. She had seen her several times during the season, but neither ever spoke. Now they got to be visiting friends.", "Mrs. Turner was a milky sort of a woman that belonged to child- bed. Her shoulders rounded a little, and she must have been conscious of her pelvis because she kept it stuck out in front of her so she could always see it. Tea Cake made a lot of fun about Mrs. Turner\u2019s shape behind her back. He claimed that she had been shaped up by a cow kicking her from behind. She was an ironing board with things throwed at it. Then that same cow took and stepped in her mouth when she was a baby and left it wide and flat with her chin and nose almost meeting.", "But Mrs. Turner\u2019s shape and features were entirely approved by Mrs. Turner. Her nose was slightly pointed and she was proud. Her thin lips were an ever delight to her eyes. Even her buttocks in bas-relief were a source of pride. To her way of thinking all these things set her aside from Negroes. That was why she sought out Janie to friend with. Janie\u2019s coffee-and-cream complexion and her luxurious hair made Mrs. Turner forgive her for wearing overalls", "like the other women who worked in the fields. She didn\u2019t forgive her for marrying a man as dark as Tea Cake, but she felt that she could remedy that. That was what her brother was born for. She seldom stayed long when she found Tea Cake at home, but when she happened to drop in and catch Janie alone, she\u2019d spend hours chatting away. Her disfavorite subject was Negroes.", "\u201cMis\u2019 Woods, Ah have often said to mah husband, Ah don\u2019t see how uh lady like Mis\u2019 Woods can stand all them common niggers round her place all de time.\u201d", "\u201cThey don\u2019t worry me atall, Mis\u2019 Turner.

He was a vanishing-looking kind of a man as if there used to be parts about him that stuck out individually but now he hadn\u2019t a thing about him that wasn\u2019t dwindled and blurred. Just like he had been sand-papered down to a long oval mass. Tea Cake felt sorry for him without knowing why. So he didn\u2019t blurt out the insults he had intended. But he couldn\u2019t hold in everything. They talked about the prospects for the coming season for a moment, then Tea Cake said, \u201cYo\u2019 wife don\u2019t seem tuh have nothin\u2019 much tuh do, so she kin visit uh lot. Mine got too much tuh do tuh go visitin\u2019 and too much tuh spend time talkin\u2019 tuh folks dat visit her.\u201d", "\u201cMah wife takes time fuh whatever she wants tuh do.

We ain\u2019t had no luck atall wid our chillun. We lucky to raise him. He\u2019s de last stroke of exhausted nature.\u201d", "He gave his powerless laugh again and Tea Cake and the boy joined in with him. Then Tea Cake walked on off and went home to Janie.", "\u201cHer husband can\u2019t do nothin\u2019 wid dat butt-headed woman. All you can do is treat her cold whenever she come round here.\u201d", "Janie tried that, but short of telling Mrs. Turner bluntly, there was nothing she could do to discourage her completely. She felt honored", "by Janie\u2019s acquaintance and she quickly forgave and forgot snubs in order to keep it. Anyone who looked more white folkish than herself was better than she was in her criteria, therefore it was right that they should be cruel to her at times, just as she was cruel to those more negroid than herself in direct ratio to their negroness. Like the pecking-order in a chicken yard. Insensate cruelty to those you can whip, and groveling submission to those you can\u2019t. Once having set up her idols and built altars to them it was inevitable that she would worship there. It was inevitable that she should accept any inconsistency and cruelty from her deity as all good worshippers do from theirs. All gods who receive homage are cruel. All gods dispense suffering without reason. Otherwise they would not be worshipped. Through indiscriminate suffering men know fear and fear is the most divine emotion. It is the stones for altars and the beginning of wisdom. Half gods are worshipped in wine and flowers. Real gods require blood.", "Mrs. Turner, like all other believers had built an altar to the unattainable\u2014Caucasian characteristics for all. Her god would smite her, would hurl her from pinnacles and lose her in deserts, but she would nor forsake his altars. Behind her crude words was a belief that somehow she and others through worship could attain her paradise\u2014a heaven of straighthaired, thin-lipped, high-nose boned white seraphs. The physical impossibilities in no way injured faith. That was the mystery and mysteries are the chores of gods. Beyond her faith was a fanaticism to defend the altars of her god. It was distressing to emerge from her inner temple and find these black desecrators howling with laughter before the door. Oh, for an army, terrible with banners and swords!", "So she didn\u2019t cling to Janie Woods the woman. She paid homage to Janie\u2019s Caucasian characteristics as such. And when she was with Janie she had a feeling of transmutation, as if she herself had become whiter and with straighter hair and she hated Tea Cake first for his defilement of divinity and next for his telling mockery of her.

She had so much to disapprove of. It didn\u2019t affect Tea Cake and Janie too much. It just gave them something to talk about in the summertime when everything was dull on the muck.

Some of these men made passes at Janie, and women who didn\u2019t know took out after Tea Cake. Didn\u2019t take them long to be put right, however. Still and all, jealousies arose now and then on both sides. When Mrs. Turner\u2019s brother came and she brought him over to be introduced, Tea Cake had a brainstorm. Before the week was over he had whipped Janie. Not because her behavior justified his jealousy, but it relieved that awful fear inside him. Being able to whip her reassured him in possession. No brutal beating at all. He just slapped her around a bit to show he was boss. Everybody talked about it next day in the fields. It aroused a sort of envy in both men and women. The way he petted and pampered her as if those two or three face slaps had nearly killed her made the women see visions and the helpless way she hung on him made men dream dreams.", "\u201cTea Cake, you sho is a lucky man,\u201d Sop-de-Bottom told him. \u201cUh person can see every place you hit her.

They quit hiding out to hold their dances when they found that their American friends didn\u2019t laugh at them as they feared. Many of the Americans learned to jump and liked it as much as the \u201cSaws.\u201d So they began to hold dances night after night in the quarters, usually behind Tea Cake\u2019s house. Often now, Tea Cake and Janie stayed up so late at the fire dances that Tea Cake would not let her go with him to the field. He wanted her to get her rest.", "So she was home by herself one afternoon when she saw a band of Seminoles passing by. The men walking in front and the laden, stolid women following them like burros. She had seen Indians several times in the \u2019Glades, in twos and threes, but this was a large party. They were headed towards the Palm Beach road and kept moving steadily. About an hour later another party appeared and went the same way. Then another just before sundown.

Hurricane coming.\u201d", "Everybody was talking about it that night. But nobody was worried. The fire dance kept up till nearly dawn. The next day, more Indians moved east, unhurried but steady. Still a blue sky and fair weather. Beans running fine and prices good, so the Indians could be, must be, wrong. You couldn\u2019t have a hurricane when you\u2019re making seven and eight dollars a day picking beans. Indians are dumb anyhow, always were.

One or two at a time, then more. By the time the people left the fields the procession was constant. Snakes, rattlesnakes began to cross the quarters. The men killed a few, but they could not be missed from the crawling horde. People stayed indoors until daylight. Several times during the night Janie heard the snort of big animals like deer. Once the muted voice of a panther. Going east and east. That night the palm and banana trees began that long distance talk with rain. Several people took fright and picked up and went in to Palm Beach anyway.

Before she could get it thoroughly hidden in the pocket of her overalls, Tea Cake burst in again.", "\u201c \u2019Tain\u2019t no cars, Janie.\u201d", "\u201cAh thought not!

Tea Cake called without moving.", "\u201cMotor Boat! You better git up from dere! Hell done broke loose in Georgy. Dis minute! How kin you sleep at uh time lak dis? Water knee-deep in de yard.\u201d", "They stepped out in water almost to their buttocks and managed to turn east. Tea Cake had to throw his box away, and Janie saw how it hurt him. Dodging flying missiles, floating dangers, avoiding stepping in holes and warmed on the wind now at their backs until they gained comparatively dry land. They had to fight to keep from being pushed the wrong way and to hold together. They saw other people like themselves struggling along. A house down, here and there, frightened cattle. But above all the drive of the wind and the water. And the lake. Under its multiplied roar could be heard a mighty sound of grinding rock and timber and a wail. They looked back. Saw people trying to run in raging waters and screaming when they found they couldn\u2019t. A huge barrier of the makings of the dike to which the cabins had been added was rolling and tumbling forward. Ten feet higher and as far as they could see the muttering wall advanced before the braced-up waters like a road crusher on a cosmic scale. The monstropolous beast had left his bed. The two hundred miles an hour wind had loosed his chains. He seized hold of his dikes and ran forward until he met the quarters; uprooted them like grass and rushed on after his supposed-to-be conquerors, rolling the dikes, rolling the houses, rolling the people in the houses along with other timbers. The sea was walking the earth with a heavy heel.", "\u201cDe lake is comin\u2019!\u201d Tea Cake gasped.", "\u201cDe lake!\u201d In amazed horror from Motor Boat, \u201cDe lake!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s comin\u2019 behind us!\u201d Janie shuddered. \u201cUs can\u2019t fly.\u201d", "\u201cBut we still kin run,\u201d Tea Cake shouted and they ran. The gushing", "water ran faster. The great body was held back, but rivers spouted through fissures in the rolling wall and broke like day. The three fugitives ran past another line of shanties that topped a slight rise and gained a little. They cried out as best they could, \u201cDe lake is comin\u2019!\u201d and barred doors flew open and others joined them in flight crying the same as they went. \u201cDe lake is comin\u2019!\u201d and the pursuing waters growled and shouted ahead, \u201cYes, Ah\u2019m comin\u2019!\u201d, and those who could fled on.", "They made it to a tall house on a hump of ground and Janie said, \u201cLess stop heah.

He knocked once more then he and Motor Boat went round to the back and forced a door. Nobody there.", "\u201cDese people had mo\u2019 sense than Ah did,\u201d Tea Cake said as they dropped to the floor and lay there panting. \u201cUs oughta went on wid \u2019Lias lak he ast me.\u201d", "\u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d Janie contended. \u201cAnd when yuh don\u2019t know, yuh just don\u2019t know.

De lake is comin\u2019!\u201d", "The lake was coming on. Slower and wider, but coming. It had trampled on most of its supporting wall and lowered its front by spreading.

Mah mama\u2019s house is yours.\u201d", "Tea Cake and Janie were some distance from the house before they struck serious water. Then they had to swim a distance, and Janie could not hold up more than a few strokes at a time, so Tea Cake bore her up till finally they hit a ridge that led on towards the fill. It seemed to him the wind was weakening a little so he kept looking for a place to rest and catch his breath. His wind was gone. Janie was tired and limping, but she had not had to do that hard swimming in the turbulent waters, so Tea Cake was much worse off. But they couldn\u2019t stop. Gaining the fill was something but it was no guarantee. The lake was coming. They had to reach the six-mile bridge. It was high and safe perhaps.", "Everybody was walking the fill. Hurrying, dragging, falling, crying, calling out names hopefully and hopelessly. Wind and rain beating", "on old folks and beating on babies. Tea Cake stumbled once or twice in his weariness and Janie held him up. So they reached the bridge at Six Mile Bend and thought to rest.", "But it was crowded. White people had preempted that point of elevation and there was no more room. They could climb up one of its high sides and down the other, that was all. Miles further on, still no rest.", "They passed a dead man in a sitting position on a hummock, entirely surrounded by wild animals and snakes. Common danger made common friends. Nothing sought a conquest over the other.", "Another man clung to a cypress tree on a tiny island. A tin roof of a building hung from the branches by electric wires and the wind swung it back and forth like a mighty ax. The man dared not move a step to his right lest this crushing blade split him open. He dared not step left for a large rattlesnake was stretched full length with his head in the wind. There was a strip of water between the island and the fill, and the man clung to the tree and cried for help.", "\u201cDe snake won\u2019t bite yuh,\u201d Tea Cake yelled to him. \u201cHe skeered tuh go intuh uh coil. Skeered he\u2019ll be blowed away. Step round dat side and swim off!\u201d", "Soon after that Tea Cake felt he couldn\u2019t walk anymore. Not right away. So he stretched long side of the road to rest. Janie spread herself between him and the wind and he closed his eyes and let the tiredness seep out of his limbs. On each side of the fill was a great expanse of water like lakes\u2014water full of things living and dead. Things that didn\u2019t belong in water. As far as the eye could reach, water and wind playing upon it in fury. A large piece of tar-paper roofing sailed through the air and scudded along the fill until it hung against a tree. Janie saw it with joy. That was the very thing to cover Tea Cake with. She could lean against it and hold it down. The wind wasn\u2019t quite so bad as it was anyway. The very thing. Poor Tea Cake! She crept on hands and knees to the piece of roofing and caught hold of it by either side. Immediately the wind lifted both of them and she saw herself sailing off the fill to the right, out and out over", "the lashing water. She screamed terribly and released the roofing which sailed away as she plunged downward into the water.", "\u201cTea Cake!\u201d He heard her and sprang up. Janie was trying to swim but fighting water too hard. He saw a cow swimming slowly towards the fill in an oblique line. A massive built dog was sitting on her shoulders and shivering and growling. The cow was approaching Janie. A few strokes would bring her there.", "\u201cMake it tuh de cow and grab hold of her tail! Don\u2019t use yo\u2019 feet. Jus\u2019 yo\u2019 hands is enough. Dat\u2019s right, come on!\u201d", "Janie achieved the tail of the cow and lifted her head up along the cow\u2019s rump, as far as she could above water. The cow sunk a little with the added load and thrashed a moment in terror. Thought she was being pulled down by a gator. Then she continued on. The dog stood up and growled like a lion, stiff-standing hackles, stiff muscles, teeth uncovered as he lashed up his fury for the charge. Tea Cake split the water like an otter, opening his knife as he dived. The dog raced down the backbone of the cow to the attack and Janie screamed and slipped far back on the tail of the cow, just out of reach of the dog\u2019s angry jaws. He wanted to plunge in after her but dreaded the water, somehow. Tea Cake rose out of the water at the cow\u2019s rump and seized the dog by the neck. But he was a powerful dog and Tea Cake was over-tired. So he didn\u2019t kill the dog with one stroke as he had intended. But the dog couldn\u2019t free himself either. They fought and somehow he managed to bite Tea Cake high up on his cheek-bone once. Then Tea Cake finished him and sent him to the bottom to stay there. The cow relieved of a great weight was landing on the fill with Janie before Tea Cake stroked in and crawled weakly upon the fill again.", "Janie began to fuss around his face where the dog had bitten him but he said it didn\u2019t amount to anything. \u201cHe\u2019d uh raised hell though if he had uh grabbed me uh inch higher and bit me in mah eye. Yuh can\u2019t buy eyes in de store, yuh know.\u201d He flopped to the edge of the fill as if the storm wasn\u2019t going on at all. \u201cLemme rest awhile, then us got tuh make it on intuh town somehow.\u201d", "It was next day by the sun and the clock when they reached Palm", "Beach. It was years later by their bodies. Winters and winters of hardship and suffering. The wheel kept turning round and round. Hope, hopelessness and despair. But the storm blew itself out as they approached the city of refuge.", "Havoc was there with her mouth wide open. Back in the Everglades the wind had romped among lakes and trees. In the city it had raged among houses and men. Tea Cake and Janie stood on the edge of things and looked over the desolation.", "\u201cHow kin Ah find uh doctor fuh yo\u2019 face in all dis mess?\u201d Janie wailed.", "\u201cAin\u2019t got de damn doctor tuh study \u2019bout. Us needs uh place tuh rest.\u201d", "A great deal of their money and perseverance and they found a place to sleep. It was just that. No place to live at all. Just sleep. Tea Cake looked all around and sat heavily on the side of the bed.", "\u201cWell,\u201d he said humbly, \u201creckon you never \u2019spected tuh come tuh dis when you took up wid me, didja?\u201d", "\u201cOnce upon uh time, Ah never \u2019spected nothin\u2019, Tea Cake, but bein\u2019 dead from the standin\u2019 still and tryin\u2019 tuh laugh.

He bought another rifle and a pistol and he and Janie bucked each other as to who was the best shot with Janie ranking him always with the rifle.

Tea Cake was a little jealous, but proud of his pupil.", "About the middle of the fourth week Tea Cake came home early", "one afternoon complaining of his head.

As soon as she was well out of sight, Tea Cake got up and dumped the water bucket and washed it clean. Then he struggled to the irrigation pump and filled it again. He was not accusing Janie of malice and design. He was accusing her of carelessness. She ought to realize that water buckets needed washing like everything else. He\u2019d tell her about it good and proper when she got back. What was she thinking about nohow? He found himself very angry about it. He eased the bucket on the table and sat down to rest before taking a drink.", "Finally he dipped up a drink. It was so good and cool! Come to think about it, he hadn\u2019t had a drink since yesterday. That was what he needed to give him an appetite for his beans. He found himself wanting it very much, so he threw back his head as he rushed the glass to his lips. But the demon was there before him, strangling, killing him quickly. It was a great relief to expel the water from his mouth. He sprawled on the bed again and lay there shivering until Janie and the doctor arrived. The white doctor who had been around so long that he was part of the muck. Who told the workmen stories with brawny sweaty words in them. He came into the house quickly, hat sitting on the left back corner of his head.", "\u201cHi there, Tea Cake. What de hell\u2019s de matter with you?\u201d \u201cWisht Ah knowed, Doctah Simmons.

People in his condition can\u2019t swallow water, you know, and in other ways it\u2019s terrible.\u201d", "Janie fooled around outside awhile to try and think it wasn\u2019t so. If she didn\u2019t see the sickness in his face she could imagine it wasn\u2019t really happening. Well, she thought, that big old dawg with the hatred in his eyes had killed her after all. She wished she had slipped off that cow-tail and drowned then and there and been done. But to kill her through Tea Cake was too much to bear. Tea Cake, the son of Evening Sun, had to die for loving her. She looked hard at the sky for a long time. Somewhere up there beyond blue ether\u2019s bosom sat He. Was He noticing what was going on around here? He must be because He knew everything. Did He mean to do this thing to", "Tea Cake and her? It wasn\u2019t anything she could fight. She could only ache and wait. Maybe it was some big tease and when He saw it had gone far enough He\u2019d give her a sign. She looked hard for something up there to move for a sign. A star in the daytime, maybe, or the sun to shout, or even a mutter of thunder. Her arms went up in a desperate supplication for a minute. It wasn\u2019t exactly pleading, it was asking questions. The sky stayed hard looking and quiet so she went inside the house. God would do less than He had in His heart.", "Tea Cake was lying with his eyes closed and Janie hoped he was asleep. He wasn\u2019t. A great fear had took hold of him. What was this thing that set his brains afire and grabbed at his throat with iron fingers? Where did it come from and why did it hang around him? He hoped it would stop before Janie noticed anything. He wanted to try to drink water again but he didn\u2019t want her to see him fail. As soon as she got out of the kitchen he meant to go to the bucket and drink right quick before anything had time to stop him. No need to worry Janie, until he couldn\u2019t help it. He heard her cleaning out the stove and saw her go out back to empty the ashes. He leaped at the bucket at once. But this time the sight of the water was enough. He was on the kitchen floor in great agony when she returned. She petted him, soothed him, and got him back to bed. She made up her mind to go see about that medicine from Palm Beach. Maybe she could find somebody to drive over there for it.", "\u201cFeel better now, Tea Cake, baby chile?\u201d \u201cUh huh, uh little.\u201d", "\u201cWell, b\u2019lieve Ah\u2019ll rake up de front yard.

They didn\u2019t have any serum but they had wired Miami to send it. She needn\u2019t worry. It would be there early the next morning if not before. People didn\u2019t fool around in a case like that. No, it wouldn\u2019t do for her to hire no car to go after it. Just go home and wait. That was all. When she reached home the visitors rose to go.", "When they were alone Tea Cake wanted to put his head in Janie\u2019s lap and tell her how he felt and let her mama him in her sweet way. But something Sop had told him made his tongue lie cold and heavy like a dead lizard between his jaws. Mrs. Turner\u2019s brother was back on the muck and now he had this mysterious sickness.

It was then she felt the pistol under the pillow. It gave her a quick ugly throb, but she didn\u2019t ask him about it since he didn\u2019t say. Never had Tea Cake slept with a pistol under his head before. \u201cNeb\u2019 mind \u2019bout all dat cleanin\u2019 round de front yard,\u201d he told her as she straightened up from fixing the bed. \u201cYou stay where Ah kin see yuh.\u201d", "\u201cAll right, Tea Cake, jus\u2019 as you say.\u201d", "\u201cAnd if Mis\u2019 Turner\u2019s lap-legged brother come prowlin\u2019 by heah you kin tell \u2019im Ah got him stopped wid four wheel brakes. \u2019Tain\u2019t no need of him standin\u2019 \u2019round watchin\u2019 de job.\u201d", "\u201cAh won\u2019t be tellin\u2019 him nothin\u2019 \u2019cause Ah don\u2019t expect tuh see \u2019im.\u201d Tea Cake had two bad attacks that night. Janie saw a changing look come in his face. Tea Cake was gone. Something else was looking out of his face. She made up her mind to be off after the doctor with the first glow of day. So she was up and dressed when", "Tea Cake awoke from the fitful sleep that had come to him just before day. He almost snarled when he saw her dressed to go.", "\u201cWhere are you goin\u2019, Janie?\u201d", "\u201cAfter de doctor, Tea Cake. You\u2019se too sick tuh be heah in dis house \u2019thout de doctah. Maybe we oughta git yuh tuh de hospital.\u201d", "\u201cAh ain\u2019t goin\u2019 tuh no hospital no where.

Dat\u2019s all.\u201d", "He gave her a look full of blank ferocity and gurgled in his throat. She saw him sitting up in bed and moving about so that he could watch her every move. And she was beginning to feel fear of this strange thing in Tea Cake\u2019s body. So when he went out to the outhouse she rushed to see if the pistol was loaded. It was a six shooter and three of the chambers were full. She started to unload it but she feared he might break it and find out she knew. That might urge his disordered mind to action. If that medicine would only come! She whirled the cylinder so that if he even did draw the gun on her it would snap three times before it would fire. She would at least have warning. She could either run or try to take it away before it was too late. Anyway Tea Cake wouldn\u2019t hurt her. He was jealous and wanted to scare her. She\u2019d just be in the kitchen as usual and never let on. They\u2019d laugh over it when he got well. She found the box of cartridges, however, and emptied it. Just as well to take the rifle from back of the head of the bed. She broke it and put the shell in her apron pocket and put it in a corner in the kitchen almost behind the stove where it was hard to see. She could outrun his knife if it came to that. Of course she was too fussy, but it did no harm to play safe. She ought not to let poor sick Tea Cake do something that would run him crazy when he found out what he had done.", "She saw him coming from the outhouse with a queer loping gait, swinging his head from side to side and his jaws clenched in a funny way. This was too awful! Where was Dr. Simmons with that medicine? She was glad she was here to look after him. Folks would do such mean things to her Tea Cake if they saw him in such a fix. Treat Tea Cake like he was some mad dog when nobody in the world had more kindness about them. All he needed was for the doctor to come on with that medicine. He came back into the house without speaking, in fact, he did not seem to notice she was there and fell heavily into the bed and slept. Janie was standing by the stove washing up the dishes when he spoke to her in a queer cold voice.", "\u201cJanie, how come you can\u2019t sleep in de same bed wid me no mo\u2019?\u201d \u201cDe doctah told you tuh sleep by yo\u2019self, Tea Cake. Don\u2019t yuh", "remember him tellin\u2019 you dat yistiddy?\u201d", "\u201cHow come you ruther sleep on uh pallet than tuh sleep in de bed wid me?\u201d Janie saw then that he had the gun in his hand that was hanging to his side. \u201cAnswer me when Ah speak.\u201d", "\u201cTea Cake, Tea Cake, honey! Go lay down! Ah\u2019ll be too glad tuh be in dere wid yuh de minute de doctor say so. Go lay back down. He\u2019ll be heah wid some new medicine right away.\u201d", "\u201cJanie, Ah done went through everything tuh be good tuh you and it hurt me tuh mah heart tuh be ill treated lak Ah is.\u201d", "The gun came up unsteadily but quickly and leveled at Janie\u2019s breast. She noted that even in his delirium he took good aim. Maybe he would point to scare her, that was all.", "The pistol snapped once. Instinctively Janie\u2019s hand flew behind her on the rifle and brought it around. Most likely this would scare him off. If only the doctor would come! If anybody at all would come! She broke the rifle deftly and shoved in the shell as the second click told her that Tea Cake\u2019s suffering brain was urging him on to kill.", "\u201cTea Cake, put down dat gun and go back tuh bed!\u201d Janie yelled at him as the gun wavered weakly in his hand.", "He steadied himself against the jamb of the door and Janie thought to run into him and grab his arm, but she saw the quick", "motion of taking aim and heard the click. Saw the ferocious look in his eyes and went mad with fear as she had done in the water that time. She threw up the barrel of the rifle in frenzied hope and fear. Hope that he\u2019d see it and run, desperate fear for her life. But if Tea Cake could have counted costs he would not have been there with the pistol in his hands. No knowledge of fear nor rifles nor anything else was there. He paid no more attention to the pointing gun than if it were Janie\u2019s dog finger. She saw him stiffen himself all over as he leveled and took aim. The fiend in him must kill and Janie was the only thing living he saw.", "The pistol and the rifle rang out almost together. The pistol just enough after the rifle to seem its echo. Tea Cake crumpled as his bullet buried itself in the joist over Janie\u2019s head. Janie saw the look on his face and leaped forward as he crashed forward in her arms. She was trying to hover him as he closed his teeth in the flesh of her forearm. They came down heavily like that. Janie struggled to a sitting position and pried the dead Tea Cake\u2019s teeth from her arm.", "It was the meanest moment of eternity. A minute before she was just a scared human being fighting for its life. Now she was her sacrificing self with Tea Cake\u2019s head in her lap. She had wanted him to live so much and he was dead. No hour is ever eternity, but it has its right to weep. Janie held his head tightly to her breast and wept and thanked him wordlessly for giving her the chance for loving service. She had to hug him tight for soon he would be gone, and she had to tell him for the last time. Then the grief of outer darkness descended.", "So that same day of Janie\u2019s great sorrow she was in jail. And when the doctor told the sheriff and the judge how it was, they all said she must be tried that same day. No need to punish her in jail by waiting. Three hours in jail and then they set the court for her case. The time was short and everything, but sufficient people were there. Plenty of white people came to look on this strangeness. And all the Negroes for miles around. Who was it didn\u2019t know about the love between Tea Cake and Janie?", "The court set and Janie saw the judge who had put on a great", "robe to listen about her and Tea Cake. And twelve more white men had stopped whatever they were doing to listen and pass on what happened between Janie and Tea Cake Woods, and as to whether things were done right or not. That was funny too. Twelve strange men who didn\u2019t know a thing about people like Tea Cake and her were going to sit on the thing. Eight or ten white women had come to look at her too. They wore good clothes and had the pinky color that comes of good food. They were nobody\u2019s poor white folks. What need had they to leave their richness to come look on Janie in her overalls? But they didn\u2019t seem too mad, Janie thought. It would be nice if she could make them know how it was instead of those menfolks. Oh, and she hoped that undertaker was fixing Tea Cake up fine. They ought to let her go see about it. Yes, and there was Mr. Prescott that she knew right well and he was going to tell the twelve men to kill her for shooting Tea Cake. And a strange man from Palm Beach who was going to ask them not to kill her, and none of them knew.", "Then she saw all of the colored people standing up in the back of the courtroom. Packed tight like a case of celery, only much darker than that. They were all against her, she could see. So many were there against her that a light slap from each one of them would have beat her to death. She felt them pelting her with dirty thoughts. They were there with their tongues cocked and loaded, the only real weapon left to weak folks. The only killing tool they are allowed to use in the presence of white folks.", "So it was all ready after a while and they wanted people to talk so that they could know what was right to do about Janie Woods, the relic of Tea Cake\u2019s Janie. The white part of the room got calmer the more serious it got, but a tongue storm struck the Negroes like wind among palm trees. They talked all of a sudden and all together like a choir and the top parts of their bodies moved on the rhythm of it. They sent word by the bailiff to Mr. Prescott they wanted to testify in the case. Tea Cake was a good boy. He had been good to that woman. No nigger woman ain\u2019t never been treated no better. Naw suh! He worked like a dog for her and nearly killed himself saving", "her in the storm, then soon as he got a little fever from the water, she had took up with another man. Sent for him to come there from way off. Hanging was too good. All they wanted was a chance to testify. The bailiff went up and the sheriff and the judge, and the police chief, and the lawyers all came together to listen for a few minutes, then they parted again and the sheriff took the stand and told how Janie had come to his house with the doctor and how he found things when he drove out to hers.", "Then they called Dr. Simmons and he told about Tea Cake\u2019s sickness and how dangerous it was to Janie and the whole town, and how he was scared for her and thought to have Tea Cake locked up in the jail, but seeing Janie\u2019s care he neglected to do it. And how he found Janie all bit in the arm, sitting on the floor and petting Tea Cake\u2019s head when he got there. And the pistol right by his hand on the floor. Then he stepped down.", "\u201cAny further evidence to present, Mr. Prescott?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cNo, Your Honor. The State rests.\u201d", "The palm tree dance began again among the Negroes in the back. They had come to talk. The State couldn\u2019t rest until it heard.", "\u201cMistah Prescott, Ah got somethin\u2019 tuh say,\u201d Sop-de-Bottom spoke out anonymously from the anonymous herd.", "The courtroom swung round on itself to look.", "\u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you better shut your mouth up until somebody calls you,\u201d Mr. Prescott told him coldly.", "\u201cYassuh, Mr. Prescott.\u201d", "\u201cWe are handling this case. Another word out of you, out of any of you niggers back there, and I\u2019ll bind you over to the big court.\u201d", "\u201cYassuh.\u201d", "The white women made a little applause and Mr. Prescott glared at the back of the house and stepped down. Then the strange white man that was going to talk for her got up there. He whispered a little with the clerk and then called on Janie to take the stand and talk. After a few little questions he told her to tell just how it happened and to speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. So help her God.", "They all leaned over to listen while she talked. First thing she had to remember was she was not at home. She was in the courthouse fighting something and it wasn\u2019t death. It was worse than that. It was lying thoughts. She had to go way back to let them know how she and Tea Cake had been with one another so they could see she could never shoot Tea Cake out of malice.", "She tried to make them see how terrible it was that things were fixed so that Tea Cake couldn\u2019t come back to himself until he had got rid of that mad dog that was in him and he couldn\u2019t get rid of the dog and live. He had to die to get rid of the dog. But she hadn\u2019t wanted to kill him. A man is up against a hard game when he must die to beat it. She made them see how she couldn\u2019t ever want to be rid of him. She didn\u2019t plead to anybody. She just sat there and told and when she was through she hushed. She had been through for some time before the judge and the lawyer and the rest seemed to know it. But she sat on in that trial chair until the lawyer told her she could come down.", "\u201cThe defense rests,\u201d her lawyer said. Then he and Prescott whispered together and both of them talked to the judge in secret up high there where he sat. Then they both sat down.", "\u201cGentlemen of the jury, it is for you to decide whether the defendant has committed a cold blooded murder or whether she is a poor broken creature, a devoted wife trapped by unfortunate circumstances who really in firing a rifle bullet into the heart of her late husband did a great act of mercy. If you find her a wanton killer you must bring in a verdict of first degree murder. If the evidence does not justify that then you must set her free. There is no middle course.\u201d", "The jury filed out and the courtroom began to drone with talk, a few people got up and moved about. And Janie sat like a lump and waited. It was not death she feared. It was misunderstanding. If they made a verdict that she didn\u2019t want Tea Cake and wanted him dead, then that was a real sin and a shame. It was worse than murder. Then the jury was back again. Out five minutes by the courthouse clock.", "\u201cWe find the death of Vergible Woods to be entirely accidental and justifiable, and that no blame should rest upon the defendant Janie Woods.\u201d", "So she was free and the judge and everybody up there smiled with her and shook her hand. And the white women cried and stood around her like a protecting wall and the Negroes, with heads hung down, shuffled out and away. The sun was almost down and Janie had seen the sun rise on her troubled love and then she had shot Tea Cake and had been in jail and had been tried for her life and now she was free. Nothing to do with the little that was left of the day but to visit the kind white friends who had realized her feelings and thank them. So the sun went down.", "She took a room at the boarding house for the night and heard the men talking around the front.", "\u201cAw you know dem white mens wuzn\u2019t gointuh do nothin\u2019 tuh no woman dat look lak her.\u201d", "\u201cShe didn\u2019t kill no white man, did she? Well, long as she don\u2019t shoot no white man she kin kill jus\u2019 as many niggers as she please.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, de nigger women kin kill up all de mens dey wants tuh, but you bet\u2019 not kill one uh dem. De white folks will sho hang yuh if yuh do.\u201d", "\u201cWell, you know whut dey say \u2019uh white man and uh nigger woman is de freest thing on earth.\u2019 Dey do as dey please.\u201d", "Janie buried Tea Cake in Palm Beach. She knew he loved the \u2019Glades but it was too low for him to lie with water maybe washing over him with every heavy rain. Anyway, the \u2019Glades and its waters had killed him. She wanted him out of the way of storms, so she had a strong vault built in the cemetery at West Palm Beach. Janie had wired to Orlando for money to put him away. Tea Cake was the son of Evening Sun, and nothing was too good. The Undertaker did a handsome job and Tea Cake slept royally on his white silken couch among the roses she had bought. He looked almost ready to grin.", "Janie bought him a brand new guitar and put it in his hands. He would be thinking up new songs to play to her when she got there.", "Sop and his friends had tried to hurt her but she knew it was because they loved Tea Cake and didn\u2019t understand. So she sent Sop word and to all the others through him. So the day of the funeral they came with shame and apology in their faces. They wanted her quick forgetfulness. So they filled up and overflowed the ten sedans that Janie had hired and added others to the line. Then the band played, and Tea Cake rode like a Pharaoh to his tomb. No expensive veils and robes for Janie this time. She went on in her overalls. She was too busy feeling grief to dress like grief.", "\nBecause they really loved Janie just a little less than they had loved Tea Cake, and because they wanted to think well of themselves, they wanted their hostile attitude forgotten. So they blamed it all on Mrs. Turner\u2019s brother and ran him off the muck again. They\u2019d show him about coming back there posing like he was good looking and putting himself where men\u2019s wives could look at him. Even if they didn\u2019t look it wasn\u2019t his fault, he had put himself in the way.", "\u201cNaw, Ah ain\u2019t mad wid Janie,\u201d Sop went around explaining. \u201cTea Cake had done gone crazy. You can\u2019t blame her for puhtectin\u2019 herself. She wuz crazy \u2019bout \u2019im. Look at de way she put him away. Ah ain\u2019t got anything in mah heart aginst her. And Ah never woulda thought uh thing, but de very first day dat lap-legged nigger come back heah makin\u2019 out he wuz lookin\u2019 fuh work, he come astin\u2019 me \u2019bout how wuz Mr. and Mrs. Woods makin\u2019 out. Dat goes tuh show yuh he wuz up tuh somethin\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cSo when Stew Beef and Bootyny and some of de rest of \u2019em got behind \u2019im he come runnin\u2019 tuh me tuh save \u2019im. Ah told \u2019im, don\u2019t come tuh me wid yo\u2019 hair blowin\u2019 back, \u2019cause, Ah\u2019m gointuh send yuh, and Ah sho did. De bitches\u2019 baby!\u201d That was enough, they eased their feelings by beating him and running him off. Anyway, their anger against Janie had lasted two whole days and that was too long to keep remembering anything. Too much of a strain.", "They had begged Janie to stay on with them and she had stayed a few weeks to keep them from feeling bad. But the muck meant Tea Cake and Tea Cake wasn\u2019t there. So it was just a great expanse of black mud. She had given away everything in their little house except a package of garden seed that Tea Cake had bought to plant. The planting never got done because he had been waiting for the right time of the moon when his sickness overtook him. The seeds reminded Janie of Tea Cake more than anything else because he was always planting things. She had noticed them on the kitchen shelf", "when she came home from the funeral and had put them in her breast pocket. Now that she was home, she meant to plant them for remembrance.", "Janie stirred her strong feet in the pan of water. The tiredness was gone so she dried them off on the towel.", "\u201cNow, dat\u2019s how everything wuz, Pheoby, jus\u2019 lak Ah told yuh. So Ah\u2019m back home agin and Ah\u2019m satisfied tuh be heah. Ah done been tuh de horizon and back and now Ah kin set heah in mah house and live by comparisons. Dis house ain\u2019t so absent of things lak it used tuh be befo\u2019 Tea Cake come along.

They got tuh go tuh God, and they got tuh find out about livin\u2019 fuh theyselves.\u201d", "There was a finished silence after that so that for the first time they could hear the wind picking at the pine trees. It made Pheoby think of Sam waiting for her and getting fretful. It made Janie think about that room upstairs\u2014her bedroom. Pheoby hugged Janie real hard and cut the darkness in flight.", "Soon everything around downstairs was shut and fastened. Janie mounted the stairs with her lamp. The light in her hand was like a spark of sun-stuff washing her face in fire. Her shadow behind fell black and headlong down the stairs. Now, in her room, the place tasted fresh again. The wind through the open windows had broomed out all the fetid feeling of absence and nothingness. She closed in and sat down. Combing road-dust out of her hair. Thinking.", "The day of the gun, and the bloody body, and the courthouse came and commenced to sing a sobbing sigh out of every corner in the room; out of each and every chair and thing. Commenced to sing, commenced to sob and sigh, singing and sobbing. Then Tea Cake came prancing around her where she was and the song of the sigh flew out of the window and lit in the top of the pine trees. Tea Cake, with the sun for a shawl. Of course he wasn\u2019t dead. He could never be dead until she herself had finished feeling and thinking. The kiss of his memory made pictures of love and light against the wall. Here was peace. She pulled in her horizon like a great fish- net. Pulled it from around the waist of the world and draped it over her shoulder. So much of life in its meshes! She called in her soul to come and see.", "\n"]
