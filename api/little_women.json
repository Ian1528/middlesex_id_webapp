["\u201cChristmas won\u2019t be Christmas without any presents,\u201d grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. \u201cIt\u2019s so dreadful to be poor!\u201d sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all,\u201d added little Amy, with an injured sniff.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve got Father and Mother, and each other,\u201d said Beth contentedly from her corner.", "The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, \u201cWe haven\u2019t got Father, and shall not have him for a long time.\u201d She didn\u2019t say \u201cperhaps never,\u201d but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was.", "Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, \u201cYou know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can\u2019t do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don\u2019t,\u201d and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.", "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the little we should spend would do any good. We\u2019ve each got a dollar, and the army wouldn\u2019t be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I\u2019ve wanted it so long,\u201d said Jo, who was a bookworm.", "\u201cI planned to spend mine in new music,\u201d said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.", "\u201cI shall get a nice box of Faber\u2019s drawing pencils; I really need them,\u201d said Amy decidedly. \u201cMother didn\u2019t say anything about our money, and she won\u2019t wish us to give up everything.", "Let\u2019s each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I\u2019m sure we work hard enough to earn it,\u201d cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.", "\u201cI know I do\u2014teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I\u2019m longing to enjoy myself at home,\u201d began Meg, in the complaining tone again.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t have half such a hard time as I do,\u201d said Jo. \u201cHow would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you\u2019re ready to fly out the window or cry?\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can\u2019t practice well at all.\u201d And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe any of you suffer as I do,\u201d cried Amy, \u201cfor you don\u2019t have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don\u2019t know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn\u2019t rich, and insult you when your nose isn\u2019t nice.\u201d", "\u201cIf you mean libel, I\u2019d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa was a pickle bottle,\u201d advised Jo, laughing.", "\u201cI know what I mean, and you needn\u2019t be statirical about it. It\u2019s proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,\u201d returned Amy, with dignity.", "\u201cDon\u2019t peck at one another, children. Don\u2019t you wish we had the money Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy and good we\u2019d be, if we had no worries!\u201d said Meg, who could remember better times.", "\u201cYou said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in spite of their money.\u201d", "\u201cSo I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have to work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\u201d", "\u201cJo does use such slang words!\u201d observed Amy, with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug.", "Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle. \u201cDon\u2019t, Jo. It\u2019s so boyish!\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s why I do it.\u201d", "\u201cI detest rude, unladylike girls!\u201d", "\u201cI hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\u201d", "\u201cBirds in their little nests agree,\u201d sang Beth, the peacemaker, with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the \u201cpecking\u201d ended for that time.", "\u201cReally, girls, you are both to be blamed,\u201d said Meg, beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \u201cYou are old enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn\u2019t matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I\u2019ll wear it in two tails till I\u2019m twenty,\u201d cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane. \u201cI hate to think I\u2019ve got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster! It\u2019s bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy\u2019s games and work and manners! I can\u2019t get over my disappointment in not being a boy. And it\u2019s worse than ever now, for I\u2019m dying to go and fight with Papa. And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!\u201d", "And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.", "\u201cPoor Jo! It\u2019s too bad, but it can\u2019t be helped. So you must try to be contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us girls,\u201d said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch.", "\u201cAs for you, Amy,\u201d continued Meg, \u201cyou are altogether too particular and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you\u2019ll grow up an affected little goose, if you don\u2019t take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don\u2019t try to be elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as Jo\u2019s slang.\u201d", "\u201cIf Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\u201d asked Beth, ready to share the lecture.", "\u201cYou\u2019re a dear, and nothing else,\u201d answered Meg warmly, and no one contradicted her, for the \u2018Mouse\u2019 was the pet of the family.", "As young readers like to know \u2018how people look\u2019, we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable room, though the", "carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses, chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.", "Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn\u2019t like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her \u2018Little Miss Tranquility\u2019, and the name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.", "The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone brightened to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.", "\u201cThey are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair.\u201d \u201cI thought I\u2019d get her some with my dollar,\u201d said Beth. \u201cNo, I shall!\u201d cried Amy.", "\u201cI\u2019m the oldest,\u201d began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, \u201cI\u2019m the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll do,\u201d said Beth, \u201clet\u2019s each get her something for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s like you, dear! What will we get?\u201d exclaimed Jo.", "Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \u201cI shall give her a nice pair of gloves.\u201d", "\u201cArmy shoes, best to be had,\u201d cried Jo.", "\u201cSome handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\u201d said Beth.", "\u201cI\u2019ll get a little bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it won\u2019t cost much, so I\u2019ll have some left to buy my pencils,\u201d added Amy.", "\u201cHow will we give the things?\u201d asked Meg.", "\u201cPut them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles. Don\u2019t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\u201d answered Jo.", "\u201cI used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\u201d said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time.", "\u201cLet Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise her. We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night,\u201d said Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.", "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to act any more after this time. I\u2019m getting too old for such things,\u201d observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about \u2018dressing-up\u2019 frolics.", "\u201cYou won\u2019t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best actress we\u2019ve got, and there\u2019ll be an end of everything if you quit the boards,\u201d said Jo. \u201cWe ought to rehearse tonight. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don\u2019t choose to make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down easily, I\u2019ll drop. If I can\u2019t, I shall fall into a chair and be graceful. I don\u2019t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\u201d returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.", "\u201cDo it this way. Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room, crying frantically, \u2018Roderigo! Save me! Save me!\u2019\u201d and away went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.", "Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her \u201cOw!\u201d was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. \u201cIt\u2019s no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don\u2019t blame me. Come on, Meg.\u201d", "Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break. Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect. Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, \u201cHa! Ha!\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s the best we\u2019ve had yet,\u201d said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows.", "\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You\u2019re a regular Shakespeare!\u201d exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.", "\u201cNot quite,\u201d replied Jo modestly. \u201cI do think The Witches Curse, an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I\u2019d like to try Macbeth, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing part. \u2018Is that a dagger that I see before me?\u201d muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s the toasting fork, with Mother\u2019s shoe on it instead of the bread. Beth\u2019s stage-struck!\u201d cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter.", "\u201cGlad to find you so merry, my girls,\u201d said a cheery voice at the door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a \u2018can I help you\u2019 look about her which was truly delightful. She was not elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world.", "\u201cWell, dearies, how have you got on today? There was so much to do, getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn\u2019t come home to dinner. Has anyone called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\u201d", "While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched. Beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.", "As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly happy face, \u201cI\u2019ve got a treat for you after supper.\u201d", "A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her napkin, crying, \u201cA letter! A letter! Three cheers for Father!\u201d", "\u201cYes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\u201d said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.", "\u201cHurry and get done! Don\u2019t stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate, Amy,\u201d cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.", "Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready.", "\u201cI think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\u201d said Meg warmly.", "\u201cDon\u2019t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan\u2014what\u2019s its name? Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help him,\u201d exclaimed Jo, with a groan.", "\u201cIt must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\u201d sighed Amy.", "\u201cWhen will he come home, Marmee?\u201d asked Beth, with a little quiver in her voice.", "\u201cNot for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won\u2019t ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.\u201d", "They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching. Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news, and only at the end did the writer\u2019s heart over-flow with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.", "\u201cGive them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children", "to you, will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women.\u201d Everybody sniffed when they came to that part. Jo wasn\u2019t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother\u2019s shoulder and sobbed out, \u201cI am a selfish girl! But I\u2019ll truly try to be better, so he mayn\u2019t be disappointed in me by-and-by.\u201d", "\u201cWe all will,\u201d cried Meg. \u201cI think too much of my looks and hate to work, but won\u2019t any more, if I can help it.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll try and be what he loves to call me, \u2018a little woman\u2019 and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else,\u201d said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.", "Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home.", "Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo\u2019s words, by saying in her cheery voice, \u201cDo you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress when you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a Celestial City.\u201d", "\u201cWhat fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and passing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,\u201d said Jo.", "\u201cI liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,\u201d said Meg.", "\u201cI don\u2019t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top. If I wasn\u2019t too old for such things, I\u2019d rather like to play it over again,\u201d said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve.", "\u201cWe never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get before Father comes home.\u201d", "\u201cReally, Mother? Where are our bundles?\u201d asked Amy, who was a very literal young lady. \u201cEach of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather think she hasn\u2019t got", "any,\u201d said her mother.", "\u201cYes, I have. Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice pianos, and being afraid of people.\u201d", "Beth\u2019s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.", "\u201cLet us do it,\u201d said Meg thoughtfully. \u201cIt is only another name for trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to be good, it\u2019s hard work and we forget, and don\u2019t do our best.\u201d", "\u201cWe were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions, like Christian. What shall we do about that?\u201d asked Jo, delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty.", "\u201cLook under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your guidebook,\u201d replied Mrs.", "March.", "They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then out came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but tonight no one grumbled. They adopted Jo\u2019s plan of dividing the long seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them.", "At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed. No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. Meg had a voice like a flute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could lisp...", "Crinkle, crinkle, \u2019ittle \u2019tar,", "and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer. The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby.", "Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she remembered her mother\u2019s promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey. She woke Meg with a \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d and bade her see what was under her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day.", "In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature, which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.", "\u201cGirls,\u201d said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \u201cMother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away", "and all this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through the day.\u201d", "Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.", "\u201cHow good Meg is! Come, Amy, let\u2019s do as they do. I\u2019ll help you with the hard words, and they\u2019ll explain things if we don\u2019t understand,\u201d whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters\u2019 example.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad mine is blue,\u201d said Amy. and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.", "\u201cWhere is Mother?\u201d asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later.", "\u201cGoodness only knows. Some poor creeter came a-beggin\u2019, and your ma went straight off to see what was needed. There never was such a woman for givin\u2019 away vittles and drink, clothes and firin\u2019,\u201d replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.", "\u201cShe will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything ready,\u201d said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time. \u201cWhy, where is Amy\u2019s bottle of cologne?\u201d she added, as the little flask did not appear.", "\u201cShe took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on it, or some such notion,\u201d replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.", "\u201cHow nice my handkerchiefs look, don\u2019t they? Hannah washed and ironed them for me, and I marked them all myself,\u201d said Beth, looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.", "\u201cBless the child! She\u2019s gone and put \u2018Mother\u2019 on them instead of \u2018M. March\u2019. How funny!\u201d cried Jo, taking one up.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t that right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg\u2019s initials are M.M., and I don\u2019t want anyone to use these but Marmee,\u201d said Beth, looking troubled.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for no one can ever mistake now.", "It will please her very much, I know,\u201d said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.", "\u201cThere\u2019s Mother. Hide the basket, quick!\u201d cried Jo, as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall.", "Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her. \u201cWhere have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\u201d asked Meg, surprised to see,", "by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so early.", "\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, Jo! I didn\u2019t mean anyone should know till the time came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave all my money to get it, and I\u2019m truly trying not to be selfish any more.\u201d", "As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \u2018a trump\u2019, while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle.", "\u201cYou see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the minute I was up, and I\u2019m so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\u201d", "Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.", "\u201cMerry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books. We read some, and mean to every day,\u201d they all cried in chorus.", "\u201cMerry Christmas, little daughters! I\u2019m glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?\u201d", "They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came before we began!\u201d", "\u201cMay I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\u201d asked Beth eagerly.", "\u201cI shall take the cream and the muffings,\u201d added Amy, heroically giving up the article she most liked.", "Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one big plate.", "\u201cI thought you\u2019d do it,\u201d said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \u201cYou shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.\u201d", "They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and no one laughed at the queer party.", "A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.", "How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in.", "\u201cAch, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!\u201d said the poor woman, crying for joy. \u201cFunny angels in hoods and mittens,\u201d said Jo, and set them to laughing.", "In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.", "\u201cDas ist gut!\u201d \u201cDie Engel-kinder!\u201d cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a \u2018Sancho\u2019 ever since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn\u2019t get any of it. And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning.", "\u201cThat\u2019s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\u201d said Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.", "Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave quite an elegant air to the table.", "\u201cShe\u2019s coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for Marmee!\u201d cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to the seat of honor.", "Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy\u2019s cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit.", "There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to work.", "The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out. The big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.", "No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart\u2019s content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture, were Jo\u2019s chief treasures and appeared on all occasions. The smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.", "On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew apart, and the operatic tragedy began.", "\u201cA gloomy wood,\u201d according to the one playbill, was represented by a few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the distance. This cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof, bureaus for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other. The", "gruff tones of Hugo\u2019s voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding, \u201cWhat ho, minion! I need thee!\u201d", "Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter.", "Hither, hither, from thy home, Airy sprite, I bid thee come! Born of roses, fed on dew,", "Charms and potions canst thou brew? Bring me here, with elfin speed,", "The fragrant philter which I need. Make it sweet and swift and strong, Spirit, answer now my song!", "A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang...", "Hither I come,", "From my airy home, Afar in the silver moon. Take the magic spell, And use it well,", "Or its power will vanish soon!", "And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch\u2019s feet, the spirit vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play.", "A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb. A tower rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver dress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of course. Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones. Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came the grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo\u2019s shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when \u201cAlas! Alas for Zara!\u201d she forgot her train. It caught in the window, the tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins.", "A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \u201cI told you so! I told you so!\u201d With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside...", "\u201cDon\u2019t laugh! Act as if it was all right!\u201d and, ordering Roderigo up, banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara. She also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made.", "Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to free the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming and hides, sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little servant, \u201cBear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall come anon.\u201d The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando, the \u2018minion\u2019, carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.", "This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the villain\u2019s death. He was called before the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together.", "Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window, informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if he will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love.", "Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He wishes her to go into a convent, but she won\u2019t hear of it, and after a touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn\u2019t make them happy. The bag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely softens the stern sire. He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro\u2019s blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.", "Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless with laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah appeared, with \u201cMrs. March\u2019s compliments, and would the ladies walk down to supper.\u201d", "This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table, they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to get up a little treat for them, but", "anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty. There was ice cream, actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great bouquets of hot house flowers.", "It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.", "\u201cIs it fairies?\u201d asked Amy. \u201cSanta Claus,\u201d said Beth.", "\u201cMother did it.\u201d And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows. \u201cAunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,\u201d cried Jo, with a sudden inspiration.", "\u201cAll wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\u201d replied Mrs. March.", "\u201cThe Laurence boy\u2019s grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into his head? We don\u2019t know him!\u201d exclaimed Meg.", "\u201cHannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an odd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father years ago, and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse, and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk breakfast.\u201d", "\u201cThat boy put it into his head, I know he did! He\u2019s a capital fellow, and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he\u2019d like to know us but he\u2019s bashful, and Meg is so prim she won\u2019t let me speak to him when we pass,\u201d said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.", "\u201cYou mean the people who live in the big house next door, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked one of the girls. \u201cMy mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says he\u2019s very proud and doesn\u2019t like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his grandson shut up, when he isn\u2019t riding or walking with his tutor, and makes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn\u2019t come. Mother says he\u2019s very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.\u201d", "\u201cOur cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some day, for he needs fun, I\u2019m sure he does,\u201d said Jo decidedly.", "\u201cI like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I\u2019ve no objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure what was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a mercy you didn\u2019t, Mother!\u201d laughed Jo, looking at her boots. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have another play sometime that he can see. Perhaps he\u2019ll help act. Wouldn\u2019t that be jolly?\u201d", "\u201cI never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!\u201d And Meg examined her flowers with great interest.", "\u201cThey are lovely. But Beth\u2019s roses are sweeter to me,\u201d said Mrs. March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.", "Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, \u201cI wish I could send my bunch to Father. I\u2019m afraid he isn\u2019t having such a merry Christmas as we are.\u201d", "\u201cJo! Jo! Where are you?\u201d cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs.", "\u201cHere!\u201d answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window. This was Jo\u2019s favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn\u2019t mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news.", "\u201cSuch fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for tomorrow night!\u201d cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.", "\u201c\u2018Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a little dance on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u2019 Marmee is willing we should go, now what shall we wear?\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins, because we haven\u2019t got anything else?\u201d answered Jo with her mouth full.", "\u201cIf I only had a silk!\u201d sighed Meg. \u201cMother says I may when I\u2019m eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us. Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can\u2019t take any out.\u201d", "\u201cYou must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and my gloves will do, though they aren\u2019t as nice as I\u2019d like.\u201d", "\u201cMine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can\u2019t get any new ones, so I shall have to go without,\u201d said Jo, who never troubled herself much about dress.", "\u201cYou must have gloves, or I won\u2019t go,\u201d cried Meg decidedly. \u201cGloves are more important than anything else. You can\u2019t dance without them, and if you don\u2019t I should be so mortified.\u201d", "\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay still. I don\u2019t care much for company dancing. It\u2019s no fun to go sailing round. I like to fly about and cut capers.\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are so careless. She said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn\u2019t get you any more this winter. Can\u2019t you make them do?\u201d", "\u201cI can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained they are. That\u2019s all I can do. No! I\u2019ll tell you how we can manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d", "\u201cYour hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove dreadfully,\u201d began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.", "\u201cThen I\u2019ll go without. I don\u2019t care what people say!\u201d cried Jo, taking up her book.", "\u201cYou may have it, you may! Only don\u2019t stain it, and do behave nicely. Don\u2019t put your hands behind you, or stare, or say \u2018Christopher Columbus!\u2019 will you?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be as prim as I can and not get into any scrapes, if I can help it.", "Now go and answer your note, and let me finish this splendid story.\u201d", "So Meg went away to \u2018accept with thanks\u2019, look over her dress, and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.", "On New Year\u2019s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the all-important business of \u2018getting ready for the party\u2019. Simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.", "\u201cOught they to smoke like that?\u201d asked Beth from her perch on the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s the dampness drying,\u201d replied Jo.", "\u201cWhat a queer smell! It\u2019s like burned feathers,\u201d observed Amy, smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.", "\u201cThere, now I\u2019ll take off the papers and you\u2019ll see a cloud of little ringlets,\u201d said Jo, putting down the tongs.", "She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.", "\u201cOh, oh, oh! What have you done? I\u2019m spoiled! I can\u2019t go! My hair, oh, my hair!\u201d wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead.", "\u201cJust my luck! You shouldn\u2019t have asked me to do it. I always spoil everything. I\u2019m so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I\u2019ve made a mess,\u201d groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t spoiled. Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I\u2019ve seen many girls do it so,\u201d said Amy consolingly.", "\u201cServes me right for trying to be fine. I wish I\u2019d let my hair alone,\u201d cried Meg petulantly.", "\u201cSo do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,\u201d said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.", "After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the united exertions of the entire family Jo\u2019s hair was got up and her dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg\u2019s in silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin. Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect \u201cquite easy and fine\u201d. Meg\u2019s high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and Jo\u2019s nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.", "\u201cHave a good time, dearies!\u201d said Mrs. March, as the sisters went daintily down the walk. \u201cDon\u2019t eat much supper, and come away at eleven when I send Hannah for you.\u201d As the gate clashed behind them, a voice cried from a window...", "\u201cGirls, girls! Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?\u201d", "\u201cYes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,\u201d cried Jo, adding with a laugh as they went on, \u201cI do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake.\u201d", "\u201cIt is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,\u201d replied Meg, who had a good many little \u2018aristocratic tastes\u2019 of her own.", "\u201cNow don\u2019t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash right? And does my hair look very bad?\u201d said Meg, as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s dressing room after a prolonged prink.", "\u201cI know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind me by a wink, will you?\u201d returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush.", "\u201cNo, winking isn\u2019t ladylike. I\u2019ll lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulder straight, and take short steps, and don\u2019t shake hands if you are introduced to anyone. It isn\u2019t the thing.\u201d", "\u201cHow do you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn\u2019t that music gay?\u201d", "Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn\u2019t care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life. She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone. She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face to face with the \u2018Laurence boy\u2019.", "\u201cDear me, I didn\u2019t know anyone was here!\u201d stammered Jo, preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.", "But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little startled, \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, stay if you like.\u201d", "\u201cShan\u2019t I disturb you?\u201d", "\u201cNot a bit. I only came here because I don\u2019t know many people and felt rather strange at first, you know.\u201d", "\u201cSo did I. Don\u2019t go away, please, unless you\u2019d rather.\u201d", "The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to be polite and easy, \u201cI think I\u2019ve had the pleasure of seeing you before. You live near us, don\u2019t you?\u201d", "\u201cNext door.\u201d And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo\u2019s prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.", "That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her heartiest way, \u201cWe did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.\u201d", "\u201cGrandpa sent it.\u201d", "\u201cBut you put it into his head, didn\u2019t you, now?\u201d", "\u201cHow is your cat, Miss March?\u201d asked the boy, trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun.", "\u201cNicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I am not Miss March, I\u2019m only Jo,\u201d returned the young lady.", "\u201cI\u2019m not Mr. Laurence, I\u2019m only Laurie.\u201d \u201cLaurie Laurence, what an odd name.\u201d", "\u201cMy first name is Theodore, but I don\u2019t like it, for the fellows called me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\u201d", "\u201cI hate my name, too, so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine.", "How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\u201d \u201cI thrashed \u2019em.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.\u201d And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you like to dance, Miss Jo?\u201d asked Laurie, looking as if he thought the name suited her. \u201cI like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is lively. In a place like this I\u2019m sure to upset something, tread on people\u2019s toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of", "mischief and let Meg sail about. Don\u2019t you dance?\u201d", "\u201cSometimes. You see I\u2019ve been abroad a good many years, and haven\u2019t been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.\u201d", "\u201cAbroad!\u201d cried Jo. \u201cOh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people describe their travels.\u201d", "Laurie didn\u2019t seem to know where to begin, but Jo\u2019s eager questions soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.", "\u201cDon\u2019t I wish I\u2019d been there!\u201d cried Jo. \u201cDid you go to Paris?\u201d \u201cWe spent last winter there.\u201d", "\u201cCan you talk French?\u201d", "\u201cWe were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.\u201d \u201cDo say some! I can read it, but can\u2019t pronounce.\u201d", "\u201cQuel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?\u201d", "\u201cHow nicely you do it! Let me see ... you said, \u2018Who is the young lady in the pretty slippers\u2019, didn\u2019t you?\u201d", "\u201cOui, mademoiselle.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is pretty?\u201d", "\u201cYes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and quiet, and dances like a lady.\u201d", "Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie\u2019s bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo\u2019s gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the \u2018Laurence boy\u2019 better than ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.", "\u201cCurly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy, and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?\u201d", "It was on the tip of Jo\u2019s tongue to ask, but she checked herself in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.", "\u201cI suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your books, no, I mean studying hard.\u201d And Jo blushed at the dreadful \u2018pegging\u2019 which had escaped her.", "Laurie smiled but didn\u2019t seem shocked, and answered with a shrug. \u201cNot for a year or two. I won\u2019t go before seventeen, anyway.\u201d", "\u201cAren\u2019t you but fifteen?\u201d asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she had imagined seventeen already.", "\u201cSixteen, next month.\u201d", "\u201cHow I wish I was going to college! You don\u2019t look as if you liked it.\u201d", "\u201cI hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don\u2019t like the way fellows do either, in this country.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d", "\u201cTo live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.\u201d", "Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, \u201cThat\u2019s a splendid polka! Why don\u2019t you go and try it?\u201d", "\u201cIf you will come too,\u201d he answered, with a gallant little bow.", "\u201cI can\u2019t, for I told Meg I wouldn\u2019t, because...\u201d There Jo stopped, and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.", "\u201cBecause, what?\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t tell?\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d", "\u201cWell, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it\u2019s nicely mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it. You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know.\u201d", "But Laurie didn\u2019t laugh. He only looked down a minute, and the expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, \u201cNever mind that. I\u2019ll tell you how we can manage. There\u2019s a long hall out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.\u201d", "Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring. When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students\u2019 festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.", "\u201cI\u2019ve sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m ever going to get home,\u201d she said, rocking to and fro in pain.", "\u201cI knew you\u2019d hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I\u2019m sorry. But I don\u2019t see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all night,\u201d answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.", "\u201cI can\u2019t have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I dare say I can\u2019t get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it\u2019s a long way to the stable, and no one to send.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d", "\u201cNo, indeed! It\u2019s past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can\u2019t stop here, for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I\u2019ll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll ask Laurie. He will go,\u201d said Jo, looking relieved as the idea occurred to her.", "\u201cMercy, no! Don\u2019t ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers, and put these slippers with our things. I can\u2019t dance anymore, but as soon as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.\u201d", "\u201cThey are going out to supper now. I\u2019ll stay with you. I\u2019d rather.\u201d", "\u201cNo, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t stir.\u201d", "So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet, and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.", "\u201cOh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!\u201d exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg\u2019s glove by scrubbing her gown with it.", "\u201cCan I help you?\u201d said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie, with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.", "\u201cI was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone shook me, and here I am in a nice state,\u201d answered Jo, glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.", "\u201cToo bad! I was looking for someone to give this to. May I take it to your sister?\u201d", "\u201cOh, thank you! I\u2019ll show you where she is. I don\u2019t offer to take it myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.\u201d", "Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a \u2018nice boy\u2019. They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the midst of a quiet game of Buzz, with two or three other young people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation of pain.", "\u201cHush! Don\u2019t say anything,\u201d she whispered, adding aloud, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I turned my foot a little, that\u2019s all,\u201d and limped upstairs to put her things on.", "Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits\u2019 end, till she decided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she said, came up and offered his grandfather\u2019s carriage, which had just come for him, he said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s so early! You can\u2019t mean to go yet?\u201d began Jo, looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.", "\u201cI always go early, I do, truly! Please let me take you home. It\u2019s all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.\u201d", "That settled it, and telling him of Meg\u2019s mishap, Jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and elegant. Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the girls talked over their party in freedom.", "\u201cI had a capital time. Did you?\u201d asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and making herself comfortable.", "\u201cYes, till I hurt myself. Sallie\u2019s friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,\u201d answered Meg, cheering up at the thought.", "\u201cI saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from. Was he nice?\u201d", "\u201cOh, very! His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I had a delicious redowa with him.\u201d", "\u201cHe looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie and I couldn\u2019t help laughing. Did you hear us?\u201d", "\u201cNo, but it was very rude. What were you about all that time, hidden away there?\u201d", "Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at home. With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...", "\u201cTell about the party! Tell about the party!\u201d", "With what Meg called \u2018a great want of manners\u2019 Jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening.", "\u201cI declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me,\u201d said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair.", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\u201d And I think Jo was quite right.", "\u201cOh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,\u201d sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked.", "\u201cI wish it was Christmas or New Year\u2019s all the time. Wouldn\u2019t it be fun?\u201d answered Jo, yawning dismally.", "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It\u2019s like other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I\u2019m so fond of luxury,\u201d said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby.", "\u201cWell, we can\u2019t have it, so don\u2019t let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I\u2019m sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I\u2019ve learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so light that I shan\u2019t mind her.\u201d", "This idea tickled Jo\u2019s fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg didn\u2019t brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children, seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to", "make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.", "\u201cWhere\u2019s the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I\u2019m pretty or not?\u201d she muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. \u201cI shall have to toil and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly and sour, because I\u2019m poor and can\u2019t enjoy my life as other girls do. It\u2019s a shame!\u201d", "So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn\u2019t at all agreeable at breakfast time.", "Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak.", "Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned, and she couldn\u2019t find her rubbers. Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready.", "Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn\u2019t suit her.", "\u201cThere never was such a cross family!\u201d cried Jo, losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon her hat.", "\u201cYou\u2019re the crossest person in it!\u201d returned Amy, washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate.", "\u201cBeth, if you don\u2019t keep these horrid cats down cellar I\u2019ll have them drowned,\u201d exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.", "Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she couldn\u2019t remember how much nine times twelve was.", "\u201cGirls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off by the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,\u201d cried Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.", "There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them \u2018muffs\u2019, for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings.", "Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two.", "\u201cCuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Marmee. We are a set of rascals this morning, but we\u2019ll come home regular angels. Now then, Meg!\u201d And Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.", "They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them. Somehow it seemed as if they couldn\u2019t have got through the day without that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.", "\u201cIf Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen,\u201d cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind.", "\u201cDon\u2019t use such dreadful expressions,\u201d replied Meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.", "\u201cI like good strong words that mean something,\u201d replied Jo, catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether.", "\u201cCall yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a wretch and I don\u2019t choose to be called so.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can\u2019t sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with.\u201d", "\u201cHow ridiculous you are, Jo!\u201d But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself.", "\u201cLucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can always find something funny to keep me up. Don\u2019t croak any more, but come home jolly, there\u2019s a dear.\u201d", "Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.", "When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.", "Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary. As she said, she was \u2018fond of luxury\u2019, and her chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings\u2019 she daily saw all she wanted, for the children\u2019s older sisters were just out, and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.", "Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her offer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady\u2019s will, but the unworldly Marches only said...", "\u201cWe can\u2019t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another.\u201d", "The old lady wouldn\u2019t speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo at a friend\u2019s, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady\u2019s fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and, to every one\u2019s surprise, got on remarkably well with her irascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn\u2019t bear it", "longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.", "I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her.", "The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy chair, devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures like a regular bookworm. But, like all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of a song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice called, \u201cJosy-phine! Josy-phine!\u201d and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle, or read Belsham\u2019s Essays by the hour together.", "Jo\u2019s ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was, she had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn\u2019t read, run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training she received at Aunt March\u2019s was just what she needed, and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual \u201cJosy-phine!\u201d", "Beth was too bashful to go to school. It had been tried, but she suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to Soldiers\u2019 Aid Societies, Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could. She was a housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid. If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll have a good night, my poor dear.\u201d", "Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but a very human little girl, she often \u2018wept a little weep\u2019 as Jo said, because she couldn\u2019t take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn\u2019t keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee and the girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself, \u201cI know I\u2019ll get my music some time, if I\u2019m good.\u201d", "There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.", "If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she would have answered at once, \u201cMy nose.\u201d When she was a baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big nor red, like poor \u2018Petrea\u2019s\u2019, it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.", "\u201cLittle Raphael,\u201d as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort. Her little airs and graces were much admired, so were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words. She had a plaintive way of saying, \u201cWhen Papa was rich we did so-and-so,\u201d which was very touching, and her long words were considered \u2018perfectly elegant\u2019 by the girls.", "Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities. She had to wear her cousin\u2019s clothes. Now Florence\u2019s mama hadn\u2019t a particle of taste, and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy\u2019s artistic eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming.", "\u201cMy only comfort,\u201d she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \u201cis that Mother doesn\u2019t take tucks in my dresses whenever I\u2019m naughty, as Maria Parks\u2019s mother does. My dear, it\u2019s really dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can\u2019t come to school. When I think of this deggerredation, I feel that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow sky-rockets on it.\u201d", "Meg was Amy\u2019s confidant and monitor, and by some strange attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth\u2019s. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family. The two older", "girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way, \u2018playing mother\u2019 they called it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.", "\u201cHas anybody got anything to tell? It\u2019s been such a dismal day I\u2019m really dying for some amusement,\u201d said Meg, as they sat sewing together that evening.", "\u201cI had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I\u2019ll tell you about it,\u201d began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. \u201cI was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.\u201d", "\u201cI wish I could, and be done with it,\u201d said I, trying not to be saucy.", "\u201cThen she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and think them over while she just \u2018lost\u2019 herself for a moment. She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the Vicar of Wakefield out of my pocket, and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I\u2019d just got to where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though she only said...", "\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s all about. Go back and begin it, child.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cBack I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could. Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly, \u2018I\u2019m afraid it tires you, ma\u2019am. Shan\u2019t I stop now?\u2019\u201d", "\u201cShe caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way, \u2018Finish the chapter, and don\u2019t be impertinent, miss\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cDid she own she liked it?\u201d asked Meg.", "\u201cOh, bless you, no! But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that she didn\u2019t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming. What a pleasant life she might have if only she chose! I don\u2019t envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,\u201d added Jo.", "\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d said Meg, \u201cthat I\u2019ve got something to tell. It isn\u2019t funny, like Jo\u2019s story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came home. At the Kings\u2019 today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn\u2019t see how red and swollen their eyes were. I didn\u2019t ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn\u2019t any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.\u201d", "\u201cI think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do,\u201d said Amy, shaking her head, as if her experience of life had been a deep one. \u201cSusie Perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, \u2018Young ladies, my eye is upon you!\u2019 coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were", "laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was parrylized with fright, but she went, and oh, what do you think he did? He took her by the ear\u2014the ear! Just fancy how horrid!\u2014and led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so everyone could see.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t the girls laugh at the picture?\u201d asked Jo, who relished the scrape.", "\u201cLaugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know she did. I didn\u2019t envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldn\u2019t have made me happy after that. I never, never should have got over such a agonizing mortification.\u201d And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.", "\u201cI saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at dinner, but I forgot,\u201d said Beth, putting Jo\u2019s topsy-turvy basket in order as she talked. \u201cWhen I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn\u2019t see me, for I kept behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn\u2019t any dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day\u2019s work. Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said \u2018No\u2019, rather crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. He told her to \u2018go along and cook it\u2019, and she hurried off, so happy! Wasn\u2019t it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence\u2019s bed in heaven would be \u2018aisy\u2019.\u201d", "When they had laughed at Beth\u2019s story, they asked their mother for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, \u201cAs I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and anxious.", "\u201c\u2018Have you sons in the army?\u2019 I asked, for the note he brought was not to me.\u201d", "\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and I\u2019m going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.\u2019 he answered quietly.\u201d", "\u201c\u2018You have done a great deal for your country, sir,\u2019 I said, feeling respect now, instead of pity.\u201d \u201c\u2018Not a mite more than I ought, ma\u2019am. I\u2019d go myself, if I was any use. As I ain\u2019t, I give my", "boys, and give \u2019em free.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cHe spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I\u2019d given one man and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them. I had all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.\u201d", "\u201cTell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,\u201d said Jo, after a minute\u2019s silence.", "Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.", "\u201cOnce upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.\u201d (Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew diligently.) \u201cThese girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were constantly saying, \u2018If only we had this,\u2019 or \u2018If we could only do that,\u2019 quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things they actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy, and she said, \u2018When you feel discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.\u2019\u201d (Here Jo looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not done yet.)", "\u201cBeing sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money couldn\u2019t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people\u2019s houses, another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady who couldn\u2019t enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable as it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman\u2019s advice.\u201d", "\u201cNow, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!\u201d cried Meg.", "\u201cI like that kind of sermon. It\u2019s the sort Father used to tell us,\u201d said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo\u2019s cushion.", "\u201cI don\u2019t complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more careful than ever now, for I\u2019ve had warning from Susie\u2019s downfall,\u201d said Amy morally.", "\u201cWe needed that lesson, and we won\u2019t forget it. If we do so, you just say to us, as old Chloe did in Uncle Tom, \u2018Tink ob yer marcies, chillen!\u2019 \u2018Tink ob yer marcies!\u2019\u201d added Jo, who could not, for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though she took it to heart as much as any of them.", "\u201cWhat in the world are you going to do now, Jo?\u201d asked Meg one snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other.", "\u201cGoing out for exercise,\u201d answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.", "\u201cI should think two long walks this morning would have been enough! It\u2019s cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire, as I do,\u201d said Meg with a shiver.", "\u201cNever take advice! Can\u2019t keep still all day, and not being a pussycat, I don\u2019t like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I\u2019m going to find some.\u201d", "Meg went back to toast her feet and read Ivanhoe, and Jo began to dig paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the Marches\u2019 house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the city,", "which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers, which then surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.", "Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.", "To Jo\u2019s lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to begin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.", "\u201cThat boy is suffering for society and fun,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cHis grandpa does not know what\u2019s good for him, and keeps him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young and lively. I\u2019ve a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!\u201d", "The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of \u2018going over\u2019 was not forgotten. And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try what could be done. She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took a survey. All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.", "\u201cThere he is,\u201d thought Jo, \u201cPoor boy! All alone and sick this dismal day. It\u2019s a shame! I\u2019ll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and then say a kind word to him.\u201d", "Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and flourished her broom as she called out...", "\u201cHow do you do? Are you sick?\u201d", "Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven... \u201cBetter, thank you. I\u2019ve had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?\u201d", "\u201cNothing. It\u2019s dull as tombs up here.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you read?\u201d", "\u201cNot much. They won\u2019t let me.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t somebody read to you?\u201d", "\u201cGrandpa does sometimes, but my books don\u2019t interest him, and I hate to ask Brooke all the time.\u201d", "\u201cHave someone come and see you then.\u201d", "\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone I\u2019d like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head is weak.\u201d", "\u201cIsn\u2019t there some nice girl who\u2019d read and amuse you? Girls are quiet and like to play nurse.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know any.\u201d", "\u201cYou know us,\u201d began Jo, then laughed and stopped. \u201cSo I do! Will you come, please?\u201d cried Laurie.", "\u201cI\u2019m not quiet and nice, but I\u2019ll come, if Mother will let me. I\u2019ll go ask her. Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.\u201d", "With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was \u2018a little gentleman\u2019, and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color, and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, then a decided voice, asking for \u2018Mr. Laurie\u2019, and a surprised-looking servant came running up to announce a young lady.", "\u201cAll right, show her up, it\u2019s Miss Jo,\u201d said Laurie, going to the door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth\u2019s three kittens in the other.", "\u201cHere I am, bag and baggage,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cMother sent her love, and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats would be comforting. I knew you\u2019d laugh at them, but I couldn\u2019t refuse, she was so anxious to do something.\u201d", "It so happened that Beth\u2019s funny loan was just the thing, for in laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable at once.", "\u201cThat looks too pretty to eat,\u201d he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy\u2019s pet geranium.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it. Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It\u2019s so simple you can eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat. What a cozy room this is!\u201d", "\u201cIt might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don\u2019t know how to make them mind. It worries me though.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth brushed, so\u2014and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so\u2014and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now then, you\u2019re fixed.\u201d", "And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...", "\u201cHow kind you are! Yes, that\u2019s what it wanted. Now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?\u201d and Jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by.", "\u201cThank you! I\u2019ve read all those, and if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather talk,\u201d answered Laurie. \u201cNot a bit. I\u2019ll talk all day if you\u2019ll only set me going. Beth says I never know when to stop.\u201d", "\u201cIs Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket?\u201d asked Laurie with interest.", "\u201cYes, that\u2019s Beth. She\u2019s my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.\u201d \u201cThe pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?\u201d", "\u201cHow did you find that out?\u201d", "Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, \u201cWhy, you see I often hear you calling to one another, and when I\u2019m alone up here, I can\u2019t help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when the lamps are lighted, it\u2019s like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother. Her face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can\u2019t help watching it. I haven\u2019t got any mother, you know.\u201d And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.", "The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo\u2019s warm heart. She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...", "\u201cWe\u2019ll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you\u2019d come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she\u2019d do you heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would dance. Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we\u2019d have jolly times. Wouldn\u2019t your grandpa let you?\u201d", "\u201cI think he would, if your mother asked him. He\u2019s very kind, though he does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he\u2019s afraid I might be a bother to strangers,\u201d began Laurie, brightening more and more.", "\u201cWe are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn\u2019t think you\u2019d be a bother. We want to know you, and I\u2019ve been trying to do it this ever so long. We haven\u2019t been here a great while, you know, but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you.\u201d", "\u201cYou see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn\u2019t mind much what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn\u2019t stay here, you know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as I can.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked, then you\u2019ll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won\u2019t last long if you keep going.\u201d", "Laurie turned red again, but wasn\u2019t offended at being accused of bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.", "\u201cDo you like your school?\u201d asked the boy, changing the subject, after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about her, well pleased.", "\u201cDon\u2019t go to school, I\u2019m a businessman\u2014girl, I mean. I go to wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,\u201d answered Jo.", "Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just in time that it wasn\u2019t manners to make too many inquiries into people\u2019s affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.", "Jo liked his good breeding, and didn\u2019t mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where she reveled.", "Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter.", "\u201cOh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please,\u201d he said, taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.", "Much elated with her success, Jo did \u2018tell on\u2019, all about their plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to talking about books, and to Jo\u2019s delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.", "\u201cIf you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandfather is out, so you needn\u2019t be afraid,\u201d said Laurie, getting up.", "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d returned Jo, with a toss of the head.", "\u201cI don\u2019t believe you are!\u201d exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his moods.", "The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy. And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.", "\u201cWhat richness!\u201d sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. \u201cTheodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\u201d she added impressively.", "\u201cA fellow can\u2019t live on books,\u201d said Laurie, shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite.", "Before he could say more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with alarm, \u201cMercy me! It\u2019s your grandpa!\u201d", "\u201cWell, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,\u201d returned the boy, looking wicked. \u201cI think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don\u2019t know why I should be. Marmee said I might come, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re any the worse for it,\u201d said Jo, composing herself, though she kept", "her eyes on the door.", "\u201cI\u2019m a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I\u2019m only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. It was so pleasant, I couldn\u2019t bear to stop,\u201d said Laurie gratefully.", "\u201cThe doctor to see you, sir,\u201d and the maid beckoned as she spoke.", "\u201cWould you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,\u201d said Laurie. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me. I\u2019m happy as a cricket here,\u201d answered Jo.", "Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, \u201cI\u2019m sure now that I shouldn\u2019t be afraid of him, for he\u2019s got kind eyes, though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own. He isn\u2019t as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.", "Poor Jo blushed till she couldn\u2019t blush any redder, and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, \u201cSo you\u2019re not afraid of me, hey?\u201d", "\u201cNot much, sir.\u201d", "\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think me as handsome as your grandfather?\u201d \u201cNot quite, sir.\u201d", "\u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a tremendous will, have I?\u201d \u201cI only said I thought so.\u201d", "\u201cBut you like me in spite of it?\u201d \u201cYes, I do, sir.\u201d", "That answer pleased the old gentleman. He gave a short laugh, shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, \u201cYou\u2019ve got your grandfather\u2019s spirit, if you haven\u2019t his face. He was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend.\u201d", "\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited her exactly.", "\u201cWhat have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\u201d was the next question, sharply put. \u201cOnly trying to be neighborly, sir.\u201d And Jo told how her visit came about.", "\u201cYou think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\u201d", "\u201cYes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could, for we don\u2019t forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\u201d said Jo eagerly.", "\u201cTut, tut, tut! That was the boy\u2019s affair. How is the poor woman?\u201d", "\u201cDoing nicely, sir.\u201d And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were.", "\u201cJust her father\u2019s way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother some fine day. Tell her so. There\u2019s the tea bell, we have it early on the boy\u2019s account. Come down and go on being neighborly.\u201d", "\u201cIf you\u2019d like to have me, sir.\u201d", "\u201cShouldn\u2019t ask you, if I didn\u2019t.\u201d And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.", "\u201cWhat would Meg say to this?\u201d thought Jo, as she was marched away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home.", "\u201cHey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\u201d said the old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d come, sir,\u201d he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant little glance.", "\u201cThat\u2019s evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman.\u201d And having pulled the boy\u2019s hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while", "Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.", "The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color, light, and life in the boy\u2019s face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.", "\u201cShe\u2019s right, the lad is lonely. I\u2019ll see what these little girls can do for him,\u201d thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.", "If the Laurences had been what Jo called \u2018prim and poky\u2019, she would not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full. Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, \u201cPlease give these to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.\u201d", "They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room, but Jo\u2019s attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which stood open.", "\u201cDo you play?\u201d she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful expression. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he answered modestly.", "\u201cPlease do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t you first?\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\u201d", "So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect and regard for the \u2018Laurence\u2019 boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn\u2019t put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue.", "\u201cThat will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugarplums are not good for him. His music isn\u2019t bad, but I hope he will do as well in more important things. Going? well, I\u2019m much obliged to you, and I hope you\u2019ll come again. My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor Jo.\u201d", "He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something amiss. He shook his head.", "\u201cNo, it was me. He doesn\u2019t like to hear me play.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cNo need of that. I am not a young lady, and it\u2019s only a step. Take care of yourself, won\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYes, but you will come again, I hope?\u201d", "\u201cIf you promise to come and see us after you are well.\u201d \u201cI will.\u201d", "\u201cGood night, Laurie!\u201d", "\u201cGood night, Jo, good night!\u201d", "When all the afternoon\u2019s adventures had been told, the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.", "\u201cMother, why didn\u2019t Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?\u201d asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.", "\u201cI am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie\u2019s father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he \u2018glowered\u2019 as Jo said.\u201d", "\u201cDear me, how romantic!\u201d exclaimed Meg.", "\u201cHow silly!\u201d said Jo. \u201cLet him be a musician if he wants to, and not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I suppose. Italians are always nice,\u201d said Meg, who was a little sentimental.", "\u201cWhat do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to him, hardly,\u201d cried Jo, who was not sentimental.", "\u201cI saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent him.\u201d", "\u201cHe meant the blanc mange, I suppose.\u201d", "\u201cHow stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.\u201d", "\u201cDid he?\u201d And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before.", "\u201cI never saw such a girl! You don\u2019t know a compliment when you get it,\u201d said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.", "\u201cI think they are great nonsense, and I\u2019ll thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun. Laurie\u2019s a nice boy and I like him, and I won\u2019t have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. We\u2019ll all be good to him because he hasn\u2019t got any mother, and he may come over and see us, mayn\u2019t he, Marmee?\u201d", "\u201cYes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t call myself a child, and I\u2019m not in my teens yet,\u201d observed Amy. \u201cWhat do you say, Beth?\u201d", "\u201cI was thinking about our \u2018Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u2019,\u201d answered Beth, who had not heard a word. \u201cHow we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying, and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be our Palace Beautiful.\u201d", "\u201cWe have got to get by the lions first,\u201d said Jo, as if she rather liked the prospect.", "The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March\u2019s motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.", "All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that \u201cthe Marches were regularly splendid girls.\u201d With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship of these simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always playing truant and running over to the Marches\u2019.", "\u201cNever mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThe good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is right, and that I\u2019ve been coddling the fellow as if I\u2019d been his grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can\u2019t get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can.\u201d", "What good times they had, to be sure. Such plays and tableaux, such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her heart\u2019s content, and Laurie played \u2018lord of the manor\u2019 in the most delightful style.", "But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up courage to go to the \u2018Mansion of Bliss\u2019, as Meg called it. She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \u201cHey!\u201d so loud, that he frightened her so much her \u2018feet chattered on the floor\u2019, she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence\u2019s ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had been", "a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie\u2019s lessons and teachers. And presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March...", "\u201cThe boy neglects his music now, and I\u2019m glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn\u2019t some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma\u2019am?\u201d", "Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile...", "\u201cThey needn\u2019t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I\u2019m shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine o\u2019clock.\u201d", "Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. \u201cPlease, tell the young ladies what I say, and if they don\u2019t care to come, why, never mind.\u201d Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way...", "\u201cOh sir, they do care, very very much!\u201d", "\u201cAre you the musical girl?\u201d he asked, without any startling \u201cHey!\u201d as he looked down at her very kindly.", "\u201cI\u2019m Beth. I love it dearly, and I\u2019ll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,\u201d she added, fearing to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.", "\u201cNot a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day, so come and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\u201d", "\u201cHow kind you are, sir!\u201d", "Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...", "\u201cI had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear! Good day, madam.\u201d And away he went, in a great hurry.", "Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home. How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some pretty, easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved friend.", "She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude.", "After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. She never knew that", "Mr. Laurence opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked. She never saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what isn\u2019t always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped. Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her. At any rate she deserved both.", "\u201cMother, I\u2019m going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don\u2019t know any other way. Can I do it?\u201d asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.", "\u201cYes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making up,\u201d replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth\u2019s requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself.", "After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needlewoman, and they were finished before anyone got tired of them. Then she wrote a short, simple note, and with Laurie\u2019s help, got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.", "When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her, several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed...", "\u201cHere\u2019s a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!\u201d", "\u201cOh, Beth, he\u2019s sent you...\u201d began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.", "Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all pointing and all saying at once, \u201cLook there! Look there!\u201d Beth did look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed like a sign board to \u201cMiss Elizabeth March.\u201d", "\u201cFor me?\u201d gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.", "\u201cYes, all for you, my precious! Isn\u2019t it splendid of him? Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s the dearest old man in the world? Here\u2019s the key in the letter. We didn\u2019t open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\u201d cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.", "\u201cYou read it! I can\u2019t, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!\u201d and Beth hid her face in Jo\u2019s apron, quite upset by her present.", "Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw were... \u201cMiss March: \u201cDear Madam\u2014\u201d", "\u201cHow nice it sounds! I wish someone would write to me so!\u201d said Amy, who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.", "\u201c\u2018I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any that suited me so well as yours,\u2019\u201d continues Jo. \u201c\u2018Heart\u2019s-ease is my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver. I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow \u2018the old gentleman\u2019 to send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he lost. With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain \u201c\u2018Your grateful friend and humble servant, \u2018JAMES LAURENCE\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cThere, Beth, that\u2019s an honor to be proud of, I\u2019m sure! Laurie told me how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept all her little things carefully. Just think, he\u2019s given you her piano. That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\u201d said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before.", "\u201cSee the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and stool, all complete,\u201d added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying its beauties.", "\u201c\u2018Your humble servant, James Laurence\u2019. Only think of his writing that to you. I\u2019ll tell the girls.", "They\u2019ll think it\u2019s splendid,\u201d said Amy, much impressed by the note.", "\u201cTry it, honey. Let\u2019s hear the sound of the baby pianny,\u201d said Hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.", "So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go and thank him,\u201d said Jo, by way of a joke, for the idea of the child\u2019s really going never entered her head.", "\u201cYes, I mean to. I guess I\u2019ll go now, before I get frightened thinking about it.\u201d And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the Laurences\u2019 door.", "\u201cWell, I wish I may die if it ain\u2019t the queerest thing I ever see! The pianny has turned her head! She\u2019d never have gone in her right mind,\u201d cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle.", "They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice called out, \u201ccome in!\u201d she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, \u201cI came to thank you, sir, for...\u201d But she didn\u2019t finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed him.", "If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman wouldn\u2019t have been more astonished. But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly! And was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude can conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.", "When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, \u201cWell, I do believe the world is coming to an end.\u201d", "\u201cThat boy is a perfect cyclops, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Amy one day, as Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.", "\u201cHow dare you say so, when he\u2019s got both his eyes? And very handsome ones they are, too,\u201d cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about her friend.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about his eyes, and I don\u2019t see why you need fire up when I admire his riding.\u201d", "\u201cOh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she called him a Cyclops,\u201d exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.", "\u201cYou needn\u2019t be so rude, it\u2019s only a \u2018lapse of lingy\u2019, as Mr. Davis says,\u201d retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. \u201cI just wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse,\u201d she added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.", "\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy\u2019s second blunder.", "\u201cI need it so much. I\u2019m dreadfully in debt, and it won\u2019t be my turn to have the rag money for a month.\u201d", "\u201cIn debt, Amy? What do you mean?\u201d And Meg looked sober.", "\u201cWhy, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can\u2019t pay them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop.\u201d", "\u201cTell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls.\u201d And Meg tried to keep her countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.", "\u201cWhy, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to be thought mean, you must do it too. It\u2019s nothing but limes now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime. If she\u2019s mad with her, she eats one before her face, and doesn\u2019t offer even a suck. They treat by turns, and I\u2019ve had ever so many but haven\u2019t returned them, and I ought for they are debts of honor, you know.\u201d", "\u201cHow much will pay them off and restore your credit?\u201d asked Meg, taking out her purse.", "\u201cA quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat for you. Don\u2019t you like limes?\u201d", "\u201cNot much. You may have my share. Here\u2019s the money. Make it last as long as you can, for it isn\u2019t very plenty, you know.\u201d", "\u201cOh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket money! I\u2019ll have a grand feast, for I haven\u2019t tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate about taking any, as I couldn\u2019t return them, and I\u2019m actually suffering for one.\u201d", "Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk. During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to treat circulated through her \u2018set\u2019, and the", "attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the spot. Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess, and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow\u2019s cutting remarks about \u2018some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other people\u2019s limes, and stuck-up people who were not too proud to ask for them\u2019, and she instantly crushed \u2018that Snow girl\u2019s\u2019 hopes by the withering telegram, \u201cYou needn\u2019t be so polite all of a sudden, for you won\u2019t get any.\u201d", "A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and Amy\u2019s beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! Pride goes before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success. No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk.", "Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals, feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved. Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language of a schoolgirl, \u201cHe was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear\u201d. The word \u2018limes\u2019 was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.", "\u201cYoung ladies, attention, if you please!\u201d", "At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.", "\u201cMiss March, come to the desk.\u201d", "Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.", "\u201cBring with you the limes you have in your desk,\u201d was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.", "\u201cDon\u2019t take all.\u201d whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence of mind.", "Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust added to his wrath.", "\u201cIs that all?\u201d", "\u201cNot quite,\u201d stammered Amy. \u201cBring the rest immediately.\u201d", "With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed. \u201cYou are sure there are no more?\u201d", "\u201cI never lie, sir.\u201d", "\u201cSo I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them out of the window.\u201d", "There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips. Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times, and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This\u2014this was too much. All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.", "As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \u201cHem!\u201d and said, in his most impressive manner...", "\u201cYoung ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I never break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand.\u201d", "Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter. She was rather a favorite with \u2018old Davis\u2019, as, of course, he was called, and it\u2019s my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit\u2019s fate.", "\u201cYour hand, Miss March!\u201d was the only answer her mute appeal received, and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no difference to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck, and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her down.", "\u201cYou will now stand on the platform till recess,\u201d said Mr. Davis, resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.", "That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break her heart with crying. A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.", "During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her before. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought, \u201cI shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!\u201d", "The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last, and the word \u2018Recess!\u2019 had never seemed so welcome to her before.", "\u201cYou can go, Miss March,\u201d said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt, uncomfortable.", "He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched her things, and left the place \u201cforever,\u201d as she passionately declared to herself. She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at once. Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and Hannah shook her fist at the \u2018villain\u2019 and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle.", "No notice was taken of Amy\u2019s flight, except by her mates, but the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and delivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy\u2019s property, and departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.", "\u201cYes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a little every day with Beth,\u201d said Mrs. March that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr. Davis\u2019s manner of teaching and don\u2019t think the girls you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father\u2019s advice before I send you anywhere else.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old school. It\u2019s perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes,\u201d sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.", "\u201cI am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved some punishment for disobedience,\u201d was the severe reply, which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.", "\u201cDo you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\u201d cried Amy.", "\u201cI should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\u201d replied her mother, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure that it won\u2019t do you more good than a bolder method. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite time you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.\u201d", "\u201cSo it is!\u201d cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. \u201cI knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she didn\u2019t know it, never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn\u2019t have believed it if anyone had told her.\u201d", "\u201cI wish I\u2019d known that nice girl. Maybe she would have helped me, I\u2019m so stupid,\u201d said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.", "\u201cYou do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,\u201d answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned", "very red, and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.", "Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, \u201cIs Laurie an accomplished boy?\u201d", "\u201cYes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent. He will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting,\u201d replied her mother.", "\u201cAnd he isn\u2019t conceited, is he?\u201d asked Amy.", "\u201cNot in the least. That is why he is so charming and we all like him so much.\u201d", "\u201cI see. It\u2019s nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to show off or get perked up,\u201d said Amy thoughtfully.", "\u201cThese things are always seen and felt in a person\u2019s manner and conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display them,\u201d said Mrs. March.", "\u201cAny more than it\u2019s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once, that folks may know you\u2019ve got them,\u201d added Jo, and the lecture ended in a laugh.", "\u201cGirls, where are you going?\u201d asked Amy, coming into their room one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.", "\u201cNever mind. Little girls shouldn\u2019t ask questions,\u201d returned Jo sharply.", "Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young, it is to be told that, and to be bidden to \u201crun away, dear\u201d is still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \u201cDo tell me! I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven\u2019t got anything to do, and am so lonely.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t, dear, because you aren\u2019t invited,\u201d began Meg, but Jo broke in impatiently, \u201cNow, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all. You can\u2019t go, Amy, so don\u2019t be a baby and whine about it.\u201d", "\u201cYou are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you stopped when I came in. Aren\u2019t you going with him?\u201d", "\u201cYes, we are. Now do be still, and stop bothering.\u201d", "Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her pocket.", "\u201cI know! I know! You\u2019re going to the theater to see the Seven Castles!\u201d she cried, adding resolutely, \u201cand I shall go, for Mother said I might see it, and I\u2019ve got my rag money, and it was mean not to tell me in time.\u201d", "\u201cJust listen to me a minute, and be a good child,\u201d said Meg soothingly. \u201cMother doesn\u2019t wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let me. I\u2019ve been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I\u2019m dying for some fun. Do, Meg! I\u2019ll be ever so good,\u201d pleaded Amy, looking as pathetic as she could.", "\u201cSuppose we take her. I don\u2019t believe Mother would mind, if we bundle her up well,\u201d began Meg.", "\u201cIf she goes I shan\u2019t, and if I don\u2019t, Laurie won\u2019t like it, and it will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I should think she\u2019d hate to poke herself where she isn\u2019t wanted,\u201d said Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself.", "Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying, in her most aggravating way, \u201cI shall go. Meg says I may, and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn\u2019t anything to do with it.\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn\u2019t sit alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our pleasure. Or he\u2019ll get another seat for you, and that isn\u2019t proper when you weren\u2019t asked. You shan\u2019t stir a step, so you may just stay where you are,\u201d scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger in her hurry.", "Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls hurried down, leaving their sister wailing. For now and then she forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child. Just as the party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone, \u201cYou\u2019ll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cFiddlesticks!\u201d returned Jo, slamming the door.", "They had a charming time, for The Seven Castles Of The Diamond Lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and princesses, Jo\u2019s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it. The fairy queen\u2019s yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her \u2018sorry for it\u2019. She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble. Her anger never lasted long, and having humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.", "When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, or asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play. On going up to put away her best hat, Jo\u2019s first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had soothed her feelings by turning Jo\u2019s top drawer upside down on the floor. Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.", "There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding breathlessly, \u201cHas anyone taken my book?\u201d", "Meg and Beth said, \u201cNo.\u201d at once, and looked surprised. Amy poked the fire and said nothing.", "Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute.", "\u201cAmy, you\u2019ve got it!\u201d \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cYou know where it is, then!\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a fib!\u201d cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t got it, don\u2019t know where it is now, and don\u2019t care.\u201d", "\u201cYou know something about it, and you\u2019d better tell at once, or I\u2019ll make you.\u201d And Jo gave her a slight shake.", "\u201cScold as much as you like, you\u2019ll never see your silly old book again,\u201d cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.", "\u201cWhy not?\u201d", "\u201cI burned it up.\u201d", "\u201cWhat! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to finish before Father got home? Have you really burned it?\u201d said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy nervously.", "\u201cYes, I did! I told you I\u2019d make you pay for being so cross yesterday, and I have, so...\u201d", "Amy got no farther, for Jo\u2019s hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of grief and anger...", "\u201cYou wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I\u2019ll never forgive you as long as I live.\u201d", "Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister\u2019s ear, she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.", "The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister. Jo\u2019s book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to print. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the old manuscript, so that Amy\u2019s bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her. Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her pet. Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them.", "When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all Amy\u2019s courage to say meekly...", "\u201cPlease forgive me, Jo. I\u2019m very, very sorry.\u201d", "\u201cI never shall forgive you,\u201d was Jo\u2019s stern answer, and from that moment she ignored Amy entirely.", "No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for all had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted, and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own generous nature, softened Jo\u2019s resentment and healed the breach. It was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed. They felt this most when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb", "as a stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone. But in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.", "As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, \u201cMy dear, don\u2019t let the sun go down upon your anger. Forgive each other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow.\u201d", "Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn\u2019t quite forgive yet. So she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was listening, \u201cIt was an abominable thing, and she doesn\u2019t deserve to be forgiven.\u201d", "With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night.", "Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder cloud, and nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning, she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack of the fidgets, Meg was sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldn\u2019t even try when other people set them a virtuous example.", "\u201cEverybody is so hateful, I\u2019ll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,\u201d said Jo to herself, and off she went.", "Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient exclamation.", "\u201cThere! She promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we shall have. But it\u2019s no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book, but I think she might do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,\u201d said Meg. \u201cGo after them. Don\u2019t say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, than take a quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be friends again with all her heart.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over the hill.", "It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back. Laurie did not see, for he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go on to the first bend, and see if it\u2019s all right before we begin to race,\u201d Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.", "Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister\u2019s troubles. She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend, he shouted back...", "\u201cKeep near the shore. It isn\u2019t safe in the middle.\u201d Jo heard, but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...", "\u201cNo matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.\u201d", "Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo\u2019s heart stand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone. She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie\u2019s voice cried out...", "\u201cBring a rail. Quick, quick!\u201d", "How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed, and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more frightened than hurt.", "\u201cNow then, we must walk her home as fast as we can. Pile our things on her, while I get off these confounded skates,\u201d cried Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before.", "Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.", "\u201cAre you sure she is safe?\u201d whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice.", "\u201cQuite safe, dear. She is not hurt, and won\u2019t even take cold, I think, you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,\u201d replied her mother cheerfully.", "\u201cLaurie did it all. I only let her go. Mother, if she should die, it would be my fault.\u201d And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her.", "\u201cIt\u2019s my dreadful temper! I try to cure it, I think I have, and then it breaks out worse than ever.", "Oh, Mother, what shall I do? What shall I do?\u201d cried poor Jo, in despair.", "\u201cWatch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault,\u201d said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo cried even harder.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could do anything when I\u2019m in a passion. I get so savage, I could hurt anyone and enjoy it. I\u2019m afraid I shall do something dreadful some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help me, do help me!\u201d", "\u201cI will, my child, I will. Don\u2019t cry so bitterly, but remember this day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like it.\u201d", "\u201cYours, Mother? Why, you are never angry!\u201d And for the moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years to do so.\u201d", "The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof. She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her. The knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it, made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it, though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen.", "\u201cMother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you?\u201d asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.", "\u201cYes, I\u2019ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked,\u201d answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo\u2019s disheveled hair.", "\u201cHow did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me, for the sharp words fly out before I know what I\u2019m about, and the more I say the worse I get, till it\u2019s a pleasure to hurt people\u2019s feelings and say dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.\u201d", "\u201cMy good mother used to help me...\u201d", "\u201cAs you do us...\u201d interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.", "\u201cBut I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.\u201d", "\u201cPoor Mother! What helped you then?\u201d", "\u201cYour father, Jo. He never loses patience, never doubts or complains, but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me, and showed me that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier to try for your sakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done, and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them copy.\u201d", "\u201cOh, Mother, if I\u2019m ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,\u201d cried Jo, much touched.", "\u201cI hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch over your \u2018bosom enemy\u2019, as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not spoil your life. You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.\u201d", "\u201cI will try, Mother, I truly will. But you must help me, remind me, and keep me from flying out. I used to see Father sometimes put his finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but", "sober face, and you always folded your lips tight and went away. Was he reminding you then?\u201d asked Jo softly.", "\u201cYes. I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.\u201d", "Jo saw that her mother\u2019s eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously, \u201cWas it wrong to watch you and to speak of it? I didn\u2019t mean to be rude, but it\u2019s so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so safe and happy here.\u201d", "\u201cMy Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much I love them.\u201d", "\u201cI thought I\u2019d grieved you.\u201d", "\u201cNo, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him.\u201d", "\u201cYet you told him to go, Mother, and didn\u2019t cry when he went, and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,\u201d said Jo, wondering.", "\u201cI gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don\u2019t seem to need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to comfort and sustain me. My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of lifelong peace, happiness, and strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.\u201d", "Jo\u2019s only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words. For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother\u2019s hand, she had drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.", "Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before.", "\u201cI let the sun go down on my anger. I wouldn\u2019t forgive her, and today, if it hadn\u2019t been for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I be so wicked?\u201d said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.", "As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a smile that went straight to Jo\u2019s heart. Neither said a word, but they hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.", "\u201cI do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now,\u201d said Meg, one April day, as she stood packing the \u2018go abroady\u2019 trunk in her room, surrounded by her sisters.", "\u201cAnd so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,\u201d replied Jo, looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.", "\u201cAnd such lovely weather, I\u2019m so glad of that,\u201d added Beth, tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great occasion.", "\u201cI wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things,\u201d said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically replenished her sister\u2019s cushion.", "\u201cI wish you were all going, but as you can\u2019t, I shall keep my adventures to tell you when I come back. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the least I can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get ready,\u201d said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.", "\u201cWhat did Mother give you out of the treasure box?\u201d asked Amy, who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when the proper time came.", "\u201cA pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue sash. I wanted the violet silk, but there isn\u2019t time to make it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlaton.\u201d", "\u201cIt will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it off beautifully. I wish I hadn\u2019t smashed my coral bracelet, for you might have had it,\u201d said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.", "\u201cThere is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want,\u201d replied Meg. \u201cNow, let me see, there\u2019s my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn\u2019t it? The violet silk would be so nice. Oh, dear!\u201d", "\u201cNever mind, you\u2019ve got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always look like an angel in white,\u201d said Amy, brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted.", "\u201cIt isn\u2019t low-necked, and it doesn\u2019t sweep enough, but it will have to do. My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that I feel as if I\u2019d got a new one. My silk sacque isn\u2019t a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn\u2019t look like Sallie\u2019s. I didn\u2019t like to say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle. It\u2019s strong and neat, so I ought not to complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie\u2019s silk one with a gold top,\u201d sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor.", "\u201cChange it,\u201d advised Jo.", "\u201cI won\u2019t be so silly, or hurt Marmee\u2019s feelings, when she took so much pains to get my things. It\u2019s a nonsensical notion of mine, and I\u2019m not going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common.\u201d And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.", "\u201cAnnie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put some on mine?\u201d she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins, fresh from Hannah\u2019s hands.", "\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t, for the smart caps won\u2019t match the plain gowns without any trimming on them.", "Poor folks shouldn\u2019t rig,\u201d said Jo decidedly.", "\u201cI wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?\u201d said Meg impatiently.", "\u201cYou said the other day that you\u2019d be perfectly happy if you could only go to Annie Moffat\u2019s,\u201d observed Beth in her quiet way.", "\u201cSo I did! Well, I am happy, and I won\u2019t fret, but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn\u2019t it? There now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for Mother to pack,\u201d said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton, which she called her \u2018ball dress\u2019 with an important air.", "The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented than she went. But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life.", "The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted, at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases, crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well as she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat\u2019s pretty things, the more she envied her and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings.", "She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls were busily employed in \u2018having a good time\u2019. They shopped, walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought. Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done. Everyone petted her, and \u2018Daisey\u2019, as they called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.", "When the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin wouldn\u2019t do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed. So out came the tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie\u2019s crisp new one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud. No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms. But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard,", "bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.", "\u201cIt\u2019s for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are altogether ravishing,\u201d cried Annie, with a great sniff.", "\u201cThey are for Miss March, the man said. And here\u2019s a note,\u201d put in the maid, holding it to Meg. \u201cWhat fun! Who are they from? Didn\u2019t know you had a lover,\u201d cried the girls, fluttering about", "Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.", "\u201cThe note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,\u201d said Meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.", "\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty.", "Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was \u2018the sweetest little thing she ever saw\u2019, and they looked quite charmed with her small attention. Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didn\u2019t strike her as so very shabby now.", "She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her heart\u2019s content. Everyone was very kind, and she had three compliments. Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice. Major Lincoln asked who \u2018the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes\u2019 was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her because she \u2018didn\u2019t dawdle, but had some spring in her\u2019, as he gracefully expressed it. So altogether she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall...", "\u201cHow old is he?\u201d", "\u201cSixteen or seventeen, I should say,\u201d replied another voice.", "\u201cIt would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn\u2019t it? Sallie says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\u201d", "\u201cMrs. M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well, early as it is. The girl evidently doesn\u2019t think of it yet,\u201d said Mrs. Moffat.", "\u201cShe told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily. Poor thing! She\u2019d be so nice if she was only got up in style. Do you think she\u2019d be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?\u201d asked another voice.", "\u201cShe\u2019s proud, but I don\u2019t believe she\u2019d mind, for that dowdy tarlaton is all she has got. She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one.\u201d", "Here Meg\u2019s partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated. She was proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had just heard. For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, \u201cMrs. M. has made her plans,\u201d \u201cthat fib about her mamma,\u201d and \u201cdowdy", "tarlaton,\u201d till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard. Her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man\u2019s daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.", "Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her friends struck Meg at once. They treated her with more respect, she thought, took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and said, with a sentimental air...", "\u201cDaisy, dear, I\u2019ve sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for Thursday. We should like to know him, and it\u2019s only a proper compliment to you.\u201d", "Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely, \u201cYou are very kind, but I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t come.\u201d", "\u201cWhy not, Cherie?\u201d asked Miss Belle. \u201cHe\u2019s too old.\u201d", "\u201cMy child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!\u201d cried Miss Clara.", "\u201cNearly seventy, I believe,\u201d answered Meg, counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes.", "\u201cYou sly creature! Of course we meant the young man,\u201d exclaimed Miss Belle, laughing. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any, Laurie is only a little boy.\u201d And Meg laughed also at the queer look which the", "sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover. \u201cAbout your age,\u201d Nan said.", "\u201cNearer my sister Jo\u2019s; I am seventeen in August,\u201d returned Meg, tossing her head.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very nice of him to send you flowers, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Annie, looking wise about nothing. \u201cYes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are so fond of them. My mother", "and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know, so it is quite natural that we children should play together,\u201d and Meg hoped they would say no more.", "\u201cIt\u2019s evident Daisy isn\u2019t out yet,\u201d said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.", "\u201cQuite a pastoral state of innocence all round,\u201d returned Miss Belle with a shrug.", "\u201cI\u2019m going out to get some little matters for my girls. Can I do anything for you, young ladies?\u201d asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace.", "\u201cNo, thank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Sallie. \u201cI\u2019ve got my new pink silk for Thursday and don\u2019t want a thing.\u201d", "\u201cNor I...\u201d began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them.", "\u201cWhat shall you wear?\u201d asked Sallie.", "\u201cMy old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly torn last night,\u201d said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling very uncomfortable.", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you send home for another?\u201d said Sallie, who was not an observing young lady.", "\u201cI haven\u2019t got any other.\u201d It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, \u201cOnly that? How funny...\u201d She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly...", "\u201cNot at all. Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn\u2019t out yet? There\u2019s no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen, for I\u2019ve got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I\u2019ve outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won\u2019t you, dear?\u201d", "\u201cYou are very kind, but I don\u2019t mind my old dress if you don\u2019t, it does well enough for a little girl like me,\u201d said Meg.", "\u201cNow do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do it, and you\u2019d be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there. I shan\u2019t let anyone see you till you are done, and then we\u2019ll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,\u201d said Belle in her persuasive tone.", "Meg couldn\u2019t refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she would be \u2018a little beauty\u2019 after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.", "On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense would have added \u2018a soupcon of rouge\u2019, if Meg had not rebelled. They laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.", "\u201cMademoiselle is charmante, tres jolie, is she not?\u201d cried Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture.", "\u201cCome and show yourself,\u201d said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room where the others were waiting.", "As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that she was \u2018a little beauty\u2019. Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like a party of magpies.", "\u201cWhile I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of", "her head, Clara, and don\u2019t any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,\u201d said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I\u2019m nowhere beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you\u2019re quite French, I assure you. Let your flowers hang, don\u2019t be so careful of them, and be sure you don\u2019t trip,\u201d returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was prettier than herself.", "Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her before, were very affectionate all of a sudden. Several young gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air of interest. She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...", "\u201cDaisy March\u2014father a colonel in the army\u2014one of our first families, but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.\u201d", "\u201cDear me!\u201d said the old lady, putting up her glass for another observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat\u2019s fibs. The \u2018queer feeling\u2019 did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused, for just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.", "\u201cSilly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head. I won\u2019t care for it, or let it change me a bit,\u201d thought Meg, and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d she said, with her most grown-up air.", "\u201cJo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,\u201d answered Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her maternal tone.", "\u201cWhat shall you tell her?\u201d asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.", "\u201cI shall say I didn\u2019t know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike yourself, I\u2019m quite afraid of you,\u201d he said, fumbling at his glove button.", "\u201cHow absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like it. Wouldn\u2019t Jo stare if she saw me?\u201d said Meg, bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not.", "\u201cYes, I think she would,\u201d returned Laurie gravely. \u201cDon\u2019t you like me so?\u201d asked Meg.", "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d was the blunt reply. \u201cWhy not?\u201d in an anxious tone.", "He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer, which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.", "\u201cI don\u2019t like fuss and feathers.\u201d", "That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg walked away, saying petulantly, \u201cYou are the rudest boy I ever saw.\u201d", "Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother...", "\u201cThey are making a fool of that little girl. I wanted you to see her, but they have spoiled her entirely. She\u2019s nothing but a doll tonight.\u201d", "\u201cOh, dear!\u201d sighed Meg. \u201cI wish I\u2019d been sensible and worn my own things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.\u201d", "She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said, with his very best bow and his hand out...", "\u201cPlease forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,\u201d said Meg, trying to look offended and failing entirely.", "\u201cNot a bit of it, I\u2019m dying to do it. Come, I\u2019ll be good. I don\u2019t like your gown, but I do think you are just splendid.\u201d And he waved his hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.", "Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time, \u201cTake care my skirt doesn\u2019t trip you up. It\u2019s the plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it.\u201d", "\u201cPin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,\u201d said Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.", "Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home, they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff.", "\u201cLaurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?\u201d said Meg, as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she would not own why.", "\u201cWon\u2019t I!\u201d said Laurie, with alacrity.", "\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won\u2019t understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.\u201d", "\u201cThen why did you do it?\u201d said Laurie\u2019s eyes, so plainly that Meg hastily added...", "\u201cI shall tell them myself all about it, and \u2018fess\u2019 to Mother how silly I\u2019ve been. But I\u2019d rather do it myself. So you\u2019ll not tell, will you?\u201d", "\u201cI give you my word I won\u2019t, only what shall I say when they ask me?\u201d \u201cJust say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other? You don\u2019t look as if you were having a good time. Are you?\u201d And Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper...", "\u201cNo, not just now. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m horrid. I only wanted a little fun, but this sort doesn\u2019t pay, I find, and I\u2019m getting tired of it.\u201d", "\u201cHere comes Ned Moffat. What does he want?\u201d said Laurie, knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.", "\u201cHe put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he\u2019s coming for them. What a bore!\u201d said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused Laurie immensely.", "He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving \u2018like a pair of fools\u2019, as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that. I wouldn\u2019t, Meg, your mother doesn\u2019t like it, you know,\u201d he whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan.", "\u201cI\u2019m not Meg tonight, I\u2019m \u2018a doll\u2019 who does all sorts of crazy things. Tomorrow I shall put away my \u2018fuss and feathers\u2019 and be desperately good again,\u201d she answered with an affected little laugh.", "\u201cWish tomorrow was here, then,\u201d muttered Laurie, walking off, ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.", "Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did. After supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say good night.", "\u201cRemember!\u201d she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had already begun. \u201cSilence a la mort,\u201d replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as he went away.", "This little bit of byplay excited Annie\u2019s curiosity, but Meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadn\u2019t enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her fortnight\u2019s fun and feeling that she had \u2018sat in the lap of luxury\u2019 long enough.", "\u201cIt does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all the time. Home is a nice place, though it isn\u2019t splendid,\u201d said Meg, looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,\u201d replied her mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day. For motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children\u2019s faces.", "Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried. As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her chair and, taking Beth\u2019s stool, leaned her elbows on her mother\u2019s knee, saying bravely...", "\u201cMarmee, I want to \u2018fess\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cI thought so. What is it, dear?\u201d", "\u201cShall I go away?\u201d asked Jo discreetly.", "\u201cOf course not. Don\u2019t I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats\u2019.\u201d", "\u201cWe are prepared,\u201d said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little anxious.", "\u201cI told you they dressed me up, but I didn\u2019t tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie thought I wasn\u2019t proper. I know he did, though he didn\u2019t say so, and one man called me \u2018a doll\u2019. I knew it was silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.\u201d", "\u201cIs that all?\u201d asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies.", "\u201cNo, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether abominable,\u201d said Meg self-reproachfully.", "\u201cThere is something more, I think.\u201d And Mrs. March smoothed the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...", "\u201cYes. It\u2019s very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have people say and think such things about us and Laurie.\u201d", "Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats\u2019, and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg\u2019s innocent mind.", "\u201cWell, if that isn\u2019t the greatest rubbish I ever heard,\u201d cried Jo indignantly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you pop out and tell them so on the spot?\u201d", "\u201cI couldn\u2019t, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn\u2019t help hearing at first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn\u2019t remember that I ought to go away.\u201d", "\u201cJust wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I\u2019ll show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having \u2018plans\u2019 and being kind to Laurie because he\u2019s rich and may marry us by-and-by! Won\u2019t he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?\u201d And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke.", "\u201cIf you tell Laurie, I\u2019ll never forgive you! She mustn\u2019t, must she, Mother?\u201d said Meg, looking distressed.", "\u201cNo, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you can,\u201d said Mrs. March gravely. \u201cI was very unwise to let you go among people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say, but worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you, Meg.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, I won\u2019t let it hurt me. I\u2019ll forget all the bad and remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very much for letting me go. I\u2019ll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, Mother. I know I\u2019m a silly little girl, and I\u2019ll stay with you till I\u2019m fit to take care of myself. But it is nice to be praised and admired, and I can\u2019t help saying I like it,\u201d said Meg, looking half ashamed of the confession.", "\u201cThat is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg.\u201d Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and things of that sort. And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had", "grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow. \u201cMother, do you have \u2018plans\u2019, as Mrs. Moffat said?\u201d asked Meg bashfully.", "\u201cYes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine differ somewhat from Mrs. Moffat\u2019s, I suspect. I will tell you some of them, for the time has come when a word may set this", "romantic little head and heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but not too young to understand me, and mothers\u2019 lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in time, perhaps, so listen to my \u2018plans\u2019 and help me carry them out, if they are good.\u201d", "Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her serious yet cheery way...", "\u201cI want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good. To be admired, loved, and respected. To have a happy youth, to be well and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience. It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the happy time comes, you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear girls, I am ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the world, marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid houses, which are not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious thing, and when well used, a noble thing, but I never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for. I\u2019d rather see you poor men\u2019s wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace.\u201d", "\u201cPoor girls don\u2019t stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put themselves forward,\u201d sighed Meg.", "\u201cThen we\u2019ll be old maids,\u201d said Jo stoutly.", "\u201cRight, Jo. Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands,\u201d said Mrs. March decidedly. \u201cDon\u2019t be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these things to time. Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are not. One thing remember, my girls. Mother is always ready to be your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort of our lives.\u201d", "\u201cWe will, Marmee, we will!\u201d cried both, with all their hearts, as she bade them good night.", "As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts. The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, \u201cI\u2019d know which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see \u2019em in Chiny,\u201d and so she might, for the girls\u2019 tastes differed as much as their characters. Meg\u2019s had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it. Jo\u2019s bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying experiments. This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt Cockle-top and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned fragrant flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, with", "chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies. Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there.", "Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions, some old, some new, all more or less original. One of these was the \u2018P.C.\u2019, for as secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one, and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the Pickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with a big \u2018P.C.\u2019 in different colors on each, and the weekly newspaper called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something, while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven o\u2019clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass, Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy, who was always trying to do what she couldn\u2019t, was Nathaniel Winkle. Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short comings. On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to read:", "Again we meet to celebrate With badge and solemn rite,", "Our fifty-second anniversary, In Pickwick Hall, tonight.", "We all are here in perfect health, None gone from our small band:", "Again we see each well-known face, And press each friendly hand.", "Our Pickwick, always at his post, With reverence we greet,", "As, spectacles on nose, he reads Our well-filled weekly sheet.", "Although he suffers from a cold, We joy to hear him speak,", "For words of wisdom from him fall, In spite of croak or squeak.", "Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high, With elephantine grace,", "And beams upon the company, With brown and jovial face.", "Poetic fire lights up his eye, He struggles \u2019gainst his lot.", "Behold ambition on his brow, And on his nose, a blot.", "Next our peaceful Tupman comes, So rosy, plump, and sweet,", "Who chokes with laughter at the puns, And tumbles off his seat.", "Prim little Winkle too is here, With every hair in place,", "A model of propriety,", "Though he hates to wash his face.", "The year is gone, we still unite To joke and laugh and read, And tread the path of literature", "That doth to glory lead.", "Long may our paper prosper well, Our club unbroken be,", "And coming years their blessings pour On the useful, gay \u2018P. C.\u2019.", "(A Tale Of Venice)", "Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance. Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on. \u201cHas your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight?\u201d asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm.", "\u201cYes, is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates.\u201d", "\u201cBy my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her stern father bestows her hand,\u201d returned the troubadour.", "\u201cTis whispered that she loves the young English artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old Count,\u201d said the lady, as they joined the dance. The revel was at its height when a priest appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove, hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:", "\u201cMy lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait your services.\u201d All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over.

I can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady, now my wife.\u201d", "The count stood like one changed to stone, and turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph, \u201cTo you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have by this masked marriage.\u201d", "Why is the P.

That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went and bought it for her mother.

He likes to write, and he\u2019ll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental, don\u2019t you see?

Now, as there\u2019s nothing like \u2018taking time by the fetlock\u2019, as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present the new member.\u201d And, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.", "\u201cYou rogue! You traitor! Jo, how could you?\u201d cried the three girls, as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.", "\u201cThe coolness of you two rascals is amazing,\u201d began Mr. Pickwick, trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile. But the new member was equal to the occasion, and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most engaging manner, \u201cMr. President and ladies\u2014I beg pardon, gentlemen\u2014allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble servant of the club.\u201d", "\u201cGood! Good!\u201d cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned.", "\u201cMy faithful friend and noble patron,\u201d continued Laurie with a wave of the hand, \u201cwho has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight. I planned it, and she only gave in after lots of teasing.\u201d", "\u201cCome now, don\u2019t lay it all on yourself. You know I proposed the cupboard,\u201d broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.", "\u201cNever mind what she says. I\u2019m the wretch that did it, sir,\u201d said the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. \u201cBut on my honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club.\u201d", "\u201cHear! Hear!\u201d cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal.", "\u201cGo on, go on!\u201d added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed benignly.", "\u201cI merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if I may be allowed the expression. It\u2019s the old martin house, but I\u2019ve stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts of things, and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it will be uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key, and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.\u201d", "Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time before order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best. So it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.", "No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted, well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did add \u2018spirit\u2019 to the meetings, and \u2018a tone\u2019 to the paper, for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental. Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.", "The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, scoldings, and puppies. The old gentleman liked the fun, and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah\u2019s charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo\u2019s care. How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come.", "\u201cThe first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and I\u2019m free. Three months\u2019 vacation\u2014how I shall enjoy it!\u201d exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.", "\u201cAunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!\u201d said Jo. \u201cI was mortally afraid she\u2019d ask me to go with her. If she had, I should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard, you know, and I\u2019d rather be excused. We had a flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she\u2019d find it impossible to part from me. I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, \u2018Josyphine, won\u2019t you\u2014?\u2019 I didn\u2019t hear any more, for I basely turned and fled. I did actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.\u201d", "\u201cPoor old Jo! She came in looking as if bears were after her,\u201d said Beth, as she cuddled her sister\u2019s feet with a motherly air.", "\u201cAunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?\u201d observed Amy, tasting her mixture critically. \u201cShe means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s too warm to be particular about", "one\u2019s parts of speech,\u201d murmured Jo.", "\u201cWhat shall you do all your vacation?\u201d asked Amy, changing the subject with tact.", "\u201cI shall lie abed late, and do nothing,\u201d replied Meg, from the depths of the rocking chair. \u201cI\u2019ve been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people, so now I\u2019m going to rest and revel to my heart\u2019s content.\u201d", "\u201cNo,\u201d said Jo, \u201cthat dozy way wouldn\u2019t suit me. I\u2019ve laid in a heap of books, and I\u2019m going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree, when I\u2019m not having l\u2014\u2014\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018larks!\u2019\u201d implored Amy, as a return snub for the \u2018samphire\u2019 correction.", "\u201cI\u2019ll say \u2018nightingales\u2019 then, with Laurie. That\u2019s proper and appropriate, since he\u2019s a warbler.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time and rest, as the girls mean", "to,\u201d proposed Amy.", "\u201cWell, I will, if Mother doesn\u2019t mind. I want to learn some new songs, and my children need fitting up for the summer. They are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes.\u201d", "\u201cMay we, Mother?\u201d asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in what they called \u2018Marmee\u2019s corner\u2019.", "\u201cYou may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it. I think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play.\u201d", "\u201cOh, dear, no! It will be delicious, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Meg complacently.", "\u201cI now propose a toast, as my \u2018friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp\u2019, says. Fun forever, and no grubbing!\u201d cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the lemonade went round.", "They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day. Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o\u2019clock. Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy\u2019s books lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but \u2018Marmee\u2019s corner\u2019, which looked as usual. And there Meg sat, to \u2018rest and read\u2019, which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide, Wide World, up in the apple tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.", "At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in the afternoon and got a \u2018sweet blue muslin\u2019, had discovered, after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn\u2019t wash, which mishap made her slightly cross. Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy Brown\u2019s party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she had \u2018nothing to wear\u2019. But these were mere trifles, and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said nothing, and with Hannah\u2019s help did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the \u2018resting and reveling\u2019 process. The days kept getting longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury, Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily, that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell back into her old ways now and then. But something in the air affected her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she was \u2018a fright\u2019. Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were small, and when her sisters left her to", "amuse herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden. She didn\u2019t like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn\u2019t draw all the time. Tea parties didn\u2019t amount to much, neither did picnics, unless very well conducted. \u201cIf one could have a fine house, full of nice girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz,\u201d complained Miss Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.", "No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.", "When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen, no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.", "\u201cMercy on us! What has happened?\u201d cried Jo, staring about her in dismay.", "Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.", "\u201cMother isn\u2019t sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can. It\u2019s a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn\u2019t act a bit like herself. But she says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn\u2019t grumble but take care of ourselves.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s easy enough, and I like the idea, I\u2019m aching for something to do, that is, some new amusement, you know,\u201d added Jo quickly.", "In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah\u2019s saying, \u201cHousekeeping ain\u2019t no joke.\u201d There was plenty of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.", "\u201cI shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think of her, for she\u2019d take care of herself,\u201d said Meg, who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot.", "So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the cook\u2019s compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo was gone.", "\u201cPoor little souls, they will have a hard time, I\u2019m afraid, but they won\u2019t suffer, and it will do them good,\u201d she said, producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly little deception for which they were grateful.", "Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll get the dinner and be servant, you be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders,\u201d said Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.", "This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting. Jo, with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to dinner.", "\u201cYou\u2019d better see what you have got before you think of having company,\u201d said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.", "\u201cOh, there\u2019s corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some asparagus and a lobster, \u2018for a relish\u2019, as Hannah says. We\u2019ll have lettuce and make a salad. I don\u2019t know how, but the book tells. I\u2019ll have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you want to be elegant.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t try too many messes, Jo, for you can\u2019t make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat. I wash my hands of the dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own responsibility, you may just take care of him.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding. You\u2019ll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won\u2019t you?\u201d asked Jo, rather hurt.", "\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t know much, except about bread and a few trifles. You had better ask Mother\u2019s leave before you order anything,\u201d returned Meg prudently.", "\u201cOf course I shall. I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d And Jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers.", "\u201cGet what you like, and don\u2019t disturb me. I\u2019m going out to dinner and can\u2019t worry about things at home,\u201d said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to her. \u201cI never enjoyed housekeeping, and I\u2019m going to take a vacation today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.\u201d", "The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.", "\u201cEverything is out of sorts, somehow,\u201d she said to herself, going downstairs. \u201cThere\u2019s Beth crying, that\u2019s a sure sign that something is wrong in this family. If Amy is bothering, I\u2019ll shake her.\u201d", "Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for want of which he had died.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, I forgot him, there isn\u2019t a seed or a drop left. Oh, Pip! Oh, Pip! How could I be so cruel to you?\u201d cried Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.", "Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a coffin.", "\u201cPut him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,\u201d said Amy hopefully.", "\u201cHe\u2019s been starved, and he shan\u2019t be baked now he\u2019s dead. I\u2019ll make him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I\u2019ll never have another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one,\u201d murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.", "\u201cThe funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now, don\u2019t cry, Bethy. It\u2019s a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and lay him in my box, and after the dinner party, we\u2019ll have a nice little funeral,\u201d said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.", "Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when she discovered that the fire was out.", "\u201cHere\u2019s a sweet prospect!\u201d muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open, and poking vigorously among the cinders.", "Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the water heated. The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself that she had made good bargains, she trudged", "home again, after buying a very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid strawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure appeared, demanding tartly...", "\u201cI say, isn\u2019t bread \u2018riz\u2019 enough when it runs over the pans?\u201d", "Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. A strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she\u2019d come to dinner. Now this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and had few friends. So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories of the people whom she knew.", "Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone, and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever. The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves. The potatoes had to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at the last. The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked, having been skilfully \u2018deaconed\u2019.", "\u201cWell, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only it\u2019s mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,\u201d thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide.", "Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed, Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo\u2019s one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water hastily. Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.", "\u201cOh, what is it?\u201d exclaimed Jo, trembling.", "\u201cSalt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,\u201d replied Meg with a tragic gesture.", "Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator. She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when she met Laurie\u2019s eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts. The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did everyone else, even \u2018Croaker\u2019 as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.", "\u201cI haven\u2019t strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober ourselves with a funeral,\u201d said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend\u2019s dinner table.", "They did sober themselves for Beth\u2019s sake. Laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph, composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.", "Here lies Pip March,", "Who died the 7th of June; Loved and lamented sore, And not forgotten soon.", "At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose, for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.", "Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs. March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment.", "Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a scramble to get ready to see them. Then tea must be got, errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute. As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.", "\u201cWhat a dreadful day this has been!\u201d began Jo, usually the first to speak. \u201cIt has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,\u201d said Meg. \u201cNot a bit like home,\u201d added Amy.", "\u201cIt can\u2019t seem so without Marmee and little Pip,\u201d sighed Beth, glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.", "\u201cHere\u2019s Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you want it.\u201d", "As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.", "\u201cAre you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another week of it?\u201d she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.", "\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d cried Jo decidedly. \u201cNor I,\u201d echoed the others.", "\u201cYou think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others, do you?\u201d \u201cLounging and larking doesn\u2019t pay,\u201d observed Jo, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m tired of it and mean", "to go to work at something right off.\u201d", "\u201cSuppose you learn plain cooking. That\u2019s a useful accomplishment, which no woman should be without,\u201d said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly at the recollection of Jo\u2019s dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it.", "\u201cMother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we\u2019d get on?\u201d cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.", "\u201cYes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you got on pretty well, though I don\u2019t think you were very happy or amiable. So I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself. Don\u2019t you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all?\u201d", "\u201cWe do, Mother, we do!\u201d cried the girls.", "\u201cThen let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for everyone. It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don\u2019t,\u201d said Jo. \u201cI\u2019ll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner party I have shall be a success.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it, Marmee. I can and I will, though I\u2019m not fond of sewing. That will be better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as they are.\u201d said Meg.", "\u201cI\u2019ll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music and dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not playing,\u201d was Beth\u2019s resolution, while Amy followed their example by heroically declaring, \u201cI shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to my parts of speech.\u201d", "\u201cVery good! Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it, only don\u2019t go to the other extreme and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work and play, make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite of poverty.\u201d", "\u201cWe\u2019ll remember, Mother!\u201d and they did.", "Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail. One July day she came in with her hands full, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post.", "\u201cHere\u2019s your posy, Mother! Laurie never forgets that,\u201d she said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \u2018Marmee\u2019s corner\u2019, and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.", "\u201cMiss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\u201d continued Beth, delivering the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.", "\u201cWhy, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\u201d said Meg, looking at the gray cotton glove. \u201cDidn\u2019t you drop the other in the garden?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t, for there was only one in the office.\u201d", "\u201cI hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted. I think Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn\u2019t Laurie\u2019s writing.\u201d", "Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother\u2019s mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.", "\u201cTwo letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered the whole post office and stuck outside,\u201d said Beth, laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing.", "\u201cWhat a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, \u2018Why mind the fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!\u2019 I said I would if I had one, and he has sent me this, to try me. I\u2019ll wear it for fun, and show him I don\u2019t care for the fashion.\u201d And hanging the antique broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.", "One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said to her...", "My Dear:", "I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook. I, too, have seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving...", "Mother", "\u201cThat does me good! That\u2019s worth millions of money and pecks of praise. Oh, Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I have you to help me.\u201d", "Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears, for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging, because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote...", "Dear Jo, What ho!", "Some English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to have a jolly time. If it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m going to pitch my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet\u2014have a fire, make", "messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks.

It will be such a help to Laurie, for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some way.\u201d", "\u201cI hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people. Do you know anything about them, Jo?\u201d asked Meg.", "\u201cOnly that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys.

But I don\u2019t want to play, or sing, or say anything. I\u2019ll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you\u2019ll take care of me, Jo, so I\u2019ll go.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s my good girl. You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love you for it. Fighting faults isn\u2019t easy, as I know, and a cheery word kind of gives a lift.

Each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature. It was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put. This", "funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy\u2019s ornament.", "Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a lively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters\u2019 toilets by frequent telegrams from the window.", "\u201cThere goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock. I wish he would go too. There\u2019s Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy! Oh, mercy me! Here\u2019s a carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is lame, poor thing, he\u2019s got a crutch. Laurie didn\u2019t tell us that. Be quick, girls! It\u2019s getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare. Meg, isn\u2019t that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping?\u201d", "\u201cSo it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the mountains. There is Sallie.", "I\u2019m glad she got back in time. Am I all right, Jo?\u201d cried Meg in a flutter.", "\u201cA regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff. Now then, come on!\u201d", "\u201cOh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It\u2019s too absurd! You shall not make a guy of yourself,\u201d remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.", "\u201cI just will, though, for it\u2019s capital, so shady, light, and big. It will make fun, and I don\u2019t mind being a guy if I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d With that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed, a bright little band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims.", "Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner. The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned\u2019s assurances that he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie \u2018primmed up his mouth\u2019 when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a standoff-don\u2019t-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not \u2018dreadful\u2019, but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends.", "Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug. Jo\u2019s funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of general utility. It broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a shower came up, she said. Miss Kate decided that she was \u2018odd\u2019, but rather clever, and smiled upon her from afar.", "Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon \u2018skill and dexterity\u2019. Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge. He never", "talked to her much, but he looked at her a good deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume. He was not very wise, but very good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.", "It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet.", "\u201cWelcome to Camp Laurence!\u201d said the young host, as they landed with exclamations of delight.", "\u201cBrooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the other fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. Now, let\u2019s have a game before it gets hot, and then we\u2019ll see about dinner.\u201d", "Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took Sallie, Jo, and Ned. The English played well, but the Americans played better, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of \u201976 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers. He gave a stroke, his ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was very near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.", "\u201cI\u2019m through! Now, Miss Jo, I\u2019ll settle you, and get in first,\u201d cried the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.", "\u201cYou pushed it. I saw you. It\u2019s my turn now,\u201d said Jo sharply.", "\u201cUpon my word, I didn\u2019t move it. It rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is allowed. So, stand off please, and let me have a go at the stake.\u201d", "\u201cWe don\u2019t cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\u201d said Jo angrily.", "\u201cYankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!\u201d returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.", "Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time, colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side had nearly won, for Kate\u2019s ball was the last but one and lay near the stake.", "\u201cBy George, it\u2019s all up with us! Goodbye, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so you are finished,\u201d cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see the finish.", "\u201cYankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\u201d said Jo, with a look that made the lad redden, \u201cespecially when they beat them,\u201d she added, as, leaving Kate\u2019s ball untouched, she won the game by a clever stroke.", "Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn\u2019t do to exult over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend, \u201cGood for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him. We can\u2019t tell him so, but he won\u2019t do it again, take my word for it.\u201d", "Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and said approvingly, \u201cIt was dreadfully provoking, but you kept your temper, and I\u2019m so glad, Jo.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should certainly have boiled over if I hadn\u2019t stayed among the nettles till I got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. It\u2019s simmering now, so I hope he\u2019ll keep out of my way,\u201d returned Jo, biting her lips as she glowered at Fred from under her big hat.", "\u201cTime for lunch,\u201d said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch. \u201cCommissary general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good coffee?\u201d", "\u201cJo can,\u201d said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates.", "The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green leaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main.", "\u201cThere\u2019s salt here,\u201d said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries.", "\u201cThank you, I prefer spiders,\u201d she replied, fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death. \u201cHow dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way?\u201d added Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run short.", "\u201cI had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven\u2019t got over it yet. This is no credit to me, you know, I don\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s you and Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I\u2019m no end obliged to you. What shall we do when we can\u2019t eat anymore?\u201d asked Laurie, feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over.", "\u201cHave games till it\u2019s cooler. I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss Kate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her. She\u2019s company, and you ought to stay with her more.\u201d", "\u201cAren\u2019t you company too? I thought she\u2019d suit Brooke, but he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers. I\u2019m going, so you needn\u2019t try to preach propriety, for you can\u2019t do it, Jo.\u201d", "Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing room to play Rig-marole.", "\u201cOne person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when the next takes it up and does the same.", "It\u2019s very funny when well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over. Please start it, Mr. Brooke,\u201d said Kate, with a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman.", "Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river.", "\u201cOnce on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune, for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was very fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely, for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master, though he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to this pet of the king\u2019s, the knight rode him through the city, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine. At last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them. He went and knocked. The great door flew open, and he beheld...\u201d", "\u201cA ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, \u2018At last! At last!\u2019\u201d continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired the style. \u201c\u2019Tis she!\u2019 cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy. \u2018Oh, rise!\u2019 she said, extending a hand of marble fairness. \u2018Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you,\u2019 swore the knight, still kneeling. \u2018Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed.\u2019 \u2018Where is the villain?\u2019 \u2018In the mauve salon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.\u2019 \u2018I obey, and return victorious or dead!\u2019 With these thrilling words he rushed away, and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he received...\u201d", "\u201cA stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him,\u201d said Ned. \u201cInstantly, Sir What\u2019s-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March. At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and chilled his blood...\u201d", "\u201cA tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand,\u201d went on Meg. \u201cIt beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music.", "He sprang forward to enter, but the specter plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a...\u201d", "\u201cSnuffbox,\u201d said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the audience. \u201c\u2018Thankee,\u2019 said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. \u2018Ha! Ha!\u2019 laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all rose and began to...\u201d", "\u201cDance a hornpipe,\u201d cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, \u201cand, as they danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail. \u2018Up with the jib, reef the tops\u2019l halliards, helm hard alee, and man the guns!\u2019 roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. \u2018Go in and win, my hearties!\u2019 says the captain, and a tremendous fight began. Of course the British beat\u2014they always do.\u201d", "\u201cNo, they don\u2019t!\u201d cried Jo, aside.", "\u201cHaving taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers ran blood, for the order had been \u2018Cutlasses, and die hard!\u2019 \u2018Bosun\u2019s mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if he doesn\u2019t confess his sins double quick,\u2019 said the British captain. The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars cheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, \u2018To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea\u2019 where...\u201d", "\u201cOh, gracious! What shall I say?\u201d cried Sallie, as Fred ended his rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books. \u201cWell, they went to the bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine, hoping to discover the mystery about them, for being a woman, she was curious. By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, \u2018I\u2019ll give you a box of pearls if you can take it up,\u2019 for she wanted to restore the poor things to life, and couldn\u2019t raise the heavy load herself. So the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found by a...\u201d", "\u201cLittle goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\u201d said Amy, when Sallie\u2019s invention gave out. \u201cThe little girl was sorry for them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. \u2018Your geese will tell you, they know everything.\u2019 said the old woman. So she asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed...\u201d", "\u201c\u2018Cabbages!\u2019\u201d continued Laurie promptly. \u201c\u2018Just the thing,\u2019 said the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The knight in whom I\u2019m interested went back to find the pretty face, and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and married, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that, and mounting the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle to see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden. \u2018Will you give me a rose?\u2019 said he. \u2018You must come and get it. I can\u2019t come to you, it isn\u2019t proper,\u2019 said she, as sweet", "as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher. Then he tried to push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped, saying imploringly, \u2018Let me in! Let me in!\u2019 But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in. Whether he did or not, Frank will tell you.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m not playing, I never do,\u201d said Frank, dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple.

With practice we might do something quite clever.", "Do you know Truth?\u201d", "\u201cI hope so,\u201d said Meg soberly. \u201cThe game, I mean?\u201d", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said Fred.", "\u201cWhy, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn, and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question put by the rest. It\u2019s great fun.\u201d", "\u201cLet\u2019s try it,\u201d said Jo, who liked new experiments.", "Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo, and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.", "\u201cWho are your heroes?\u201d asked Jo. \u201cGrandfather and Napoleon.\u201d", "\u201cWhich lady here do you think prettiest?\u201d said Sallie. \u201cMargaret.\u201d", "\u201cWhich do you like best?\u201d from Fred. \u201cJo, of course.\u201d", "\u201cWhat silly questions you ask!\u201d And Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at Laurie\u2019s matter-of-fact tone.", "\u201cTry again.

Her turn came next.", "\u201cWhat is your greatest fault?\u201d asked Fred, by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself.", "\u201cA quick temper.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you most wish for?\u201d said Laurie.", "\u201cA pair of boot lacings,\u201d returned Jo, guessing and defeating his purpose. \u201cNot a true answer. You must say what you really do want most.\u201d", "\u201cGenius. Don\u2019t you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?\u201d And she slyly smiled in his disappointed face.", "\u201cWhat virtues do you most admire in a man?\u201d asked Sallie. \u201cCourage and honesty.\u201d", "\u201cNow my turn,\u201d said Fred, as his hand came last.", "\u201cLet\u2019s give it to him,\u201d whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded and asked at once...", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you cheat at croquet?\u201d \u201cWell, yes, a little bit.\u201d", "\u201cGood! Didn\u2019t you take your story out of The Sea Lion?\u201d said Laurie. \u201cRather.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t you think the English nation perfect in every respect?\u201d asked Sallie. \u201cI should be ashamed of myself if I didn\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s a true John Bull. Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance without waiting to draw. I\u2019ll harrrow up your feelings first by asking if you don\u2019t think you are something of a flirt,\u201d said Laurie, as Jo nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.", "\u201cYou impertinent boy! Of course I\u2019m not,\u201d exclaimed Sallie, with an air that proved the contrary.", "\u201cWhat do you hate most?\u201d asked Fred. \u201cSpiders and rice pudding.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you like best?\u201d asked Jo. \u201cDancing and French gloves.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I think Truth is a very silly play. Let\u2019s have a sensible game of Authors to refresh our minds,\u201d proposed Jo.", "Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on, the three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out her sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with a book, which he did not read.", "\u201cHow beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw,\u201d said Meg, with mingled admiration and regret in her voice.", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you learn?

I am a governess myself.\u201d", "\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said, \u201cDear me, how dreadful!\u201d for her tone implied it, and something in her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.", "Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, \u201cYoung ladies in America love independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and respected for supporting themselves.\u201d", "\u201cOh, yes, of course it\u2019s very nice and proper in them to do so. We have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,\u201d said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg\u2019s pride, and made her work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.", "\u201cDid the German song suit, Miss March?\u201d inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking an awkward pause.", "\u201cOh, yes! It was very sweet, and I\u2019m much obliged to whoever translated it for me.\u201d And Meg\u2019s downcast face brightened as she spoke.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you read German?\u201d asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.", "\u201cNot very well.

Try this passage.\u201d", "There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke\u2019s mouth as he opened at poor Mary\u2019s lament.", "Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice. Down the page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.", "\u201cVery well indeed!\u201d said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.", "Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension, \u201cYou\u2019ve a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader. I advise you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers. I must look after Grace, she is romping.\u201d And Miss Kate strolled away, adding to herself with a shrug, \u201cI didn\u2019t come to chaperone a governess, though she is young and pretty.

I\u2019m afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.\u201d", "\u201cI forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses and don\u2019t treat them as we do,\u201d said Meg, looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression.", "\u201cTutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my sorrow. There\u2019s no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.\u201d And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad I live in it then. I don\u2019t like my work, but I get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won\u2019t complain. I only wished I liked teaching as you do.\u201d", "\u201cI think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall be very sorry to lose him next year,\u201d said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in the turf.", "\u201cGoing to college, I suppose?\u201d Meg\u2019s lips asked the question, but her eyes added, \u201cAnd what becomes of you?\u201d", "\u201cYes, it\u2019s high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as he is off, I shall turn soldier. I am needed.\u201d", "\u201cI am glad of that!\u201d exclaimed Meg. \u201cI should think every young man would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home,\u201d she added sorrowfully.", "\u201cI have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,\u201d said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.", "\u201cLaurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you,\u201d said Meg heartily.", "\u201cThank you, that sounds pleasant,\u201d began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you love to ride?\u201d asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.", "\u201cI dote upon it. My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was rich, but we don\u2019t keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree,\u201d added Amy, laughing.", "\u201cTell me about Ellen Tree. Is it a donkey?\u201d asked Grace curiously.", "\u201cWhy, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we\u2019ve only got an old sidesaddle and no horse. Out in our garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we like.\u201d", "\u201cHow funny!\u201d laughed Grace. \u201cI have a pony at home, and ride nearly every day in the park with Fred and Kate. It\u2019s very nice, for my friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.\u201d", "\u201cDear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I\u2019d rather go to Rome than the Row,\u201d said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what the Row was and wouldn\u2019t have asked for the world.", "Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you are tired. Can I do anything for you?\u201d", "\u201cTalk to me, please. It\u2019s dull, sitting by myself,\u201d answered Frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.", "If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there was no place to run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.", "\u201cWhat do you like to talk about?\u201d she asked, fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.", "\u201cWell, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,\u201d said Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.", "My heart! What shall I do? I don\u2019t know anything about them, thought Beth, and forgetting the boy\u2019s misfortune in her flurry, she said, hoping to make him talk, \u201cI never saw any hunting, but I suppose you know all about it.\u201d", "\u201cI did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for me,\u201d said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her innocent blunder.", "\u201cYour deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,\u201d she said, turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys\u2019 books in which Jo delighted.", "Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her sisters\u2019 surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged protection.", "\u201cBless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him,\u201d said Jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground.", "\u201cI always said she was a little saint,\u201d added Meg, as if there could be no further doubt of it.", "\u201cI haven\u2019t heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,\u201d said Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups.", "\u201cMy sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,\u201d said Amy, well pleased at Beth\u2019s success. She meant \u2018facinating\u2019, but as Grace didn\u2019t know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded well and made a good impression.", "An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon. At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental, warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain...", "Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone, and at the lines...", "We each are young, we each have a heart, Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?", "he looked at Meg with such a lackadaisical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song.", "\u201cHow can you be so cruel to me?\u201d he whispered, under cover of a lively chorus. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day, and now you snub me.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and the talk after it.", "Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her rather pettishly, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?\u201d", "\u201cNot a particle, but she\u2019s a dear,\u201d returned Sallie, defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings.", "\u201cShe\u2019s not a stricken deer anyway,\u201d said Ned, trying to be witty, and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.", "On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with cordial good nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada. As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, \u201cIn spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when one knows them.\u201d", "\u201cI quite agree with you,\u201d said Mr. Brooke.", "Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too lazy to go and find out. He was in one of his", "moods, for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could live it over again. The hot weather made him indolent, and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke\u2019s patience to the utmost, displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.", "\u201cWhat in the world are those girls about now?\u201d thought Laurie, opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio. All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.", "\u201cWell, that\u2019s cool,\u201d said Laurie to himself, \u201cto have a picnic and never ask me! They can\u2019t be going in the boat, for they haven\u2019t got the key. Perhaps they forgot it. I\u2019ll take it to them, and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d", "Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went up the hill to take an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.", "\u201cHere\u2019s a landscape!\u201d thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and looking wide-awake and good-natured already.", "It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends. Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green. Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them. Amy was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud. A shadow passed over the boy\u2019s face as he watched them, feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited; yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit. He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.", "\u201cMay I come in, please? Or shall I be a bother?\u201d he asked, advancing slowly.", "Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once, \u201cOf course you may. We should have asked you before, only we thought you wouldn\u2019t care for such a girl\u2019s game as this.\u201d", "\u201cI always like your games, but if Meg doesn\u2019t want me, I\u2019ll go away.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve no objection, if you do something. It\u2019s against the rules to be idle here,\u201d replied Meg gravely but graciously.", "\u201cMuch obliged. I\u2019ll do anything if you\u2019ll let me stop a bit, for it\u2019s as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I\u2019m ready.\u201d And Laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.", "\u201cFinish this story while I set my heel,\u201d said Jo, handing him the book.", "\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the \u2018Busy Bee Society\u2019.", "The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit.", "\u201cPlease, ma\u2019am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?\u201d", "\u201cWould you tell him?\u201d asked Meg of her sisters. \u201cHe\u2019ll laugh,\u201d said Amy warningly.", "\u201cWho cares?\u201d said Jo.", "\u201cI guess he\u2019ll like it,\u201d added Beth.", "\u201cOf course I shall!

Well, you see we used to play Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all winter and summer.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Laurie, nodding wisely. \u201cWho told you?\u201d demanded Jo.", "\u201cSpirits.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I did. I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away, and he was rather dismal. He did like it, so don\u2019t scold, Jo,\u201d said Beth meekly.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t keep a secret. Never mind, it saves trouble now.\u201d", "\u201cGo on, please,\u201d said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work, looking a trifle displeased. \u201cOh, didn\u2019t she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we have tried not to waste our", "holiday, but each has had a task and worked at it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn\u2019t dawdle.\u201d", "\u201cYes, I should think so,\u201d and Laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days.", "\u201cMother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring our work here and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill, and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time.\u201d", "Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.", "\u201cHow beautiful that is!\u201d said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind. \u201cIt\u2019s often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but always splendid,\u201d replied", "Amy, wishing she could paint it.", "\u201cJo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime\u2014the real country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could ever go to it,\u201d said Beth musingly.", "\u201cThere is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go, by-and-by, when we are good enough,\u201d answered Meg with her sweetest voice.", "\u201cIt seems so long to wait, so hard to do. I want to fly away at once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,\u201d said Jo. \u201cI\u2019m the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and maybe never get in after all.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019ll have me for company, if that\u2019s any comfort. I shall have to do a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City. If I arrive late, you\u2019ll say a good word for me, won\u2019t you, Beth?\u201d", "Something in the boy\u2019s face troubled his little friend, but she said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, \u201cIf people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will get in, for I don\u2019t believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river.\u201d", "\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true, and we could live in them?\u201d said Jo, after a little pause.", "\u201cI\u2019ve made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I\u2019d have,\u201d said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him.", "\u201cYou\u2019d have to take your favorite one.

Now, Laurie.\u201d", "\u201cAfter I\u2019d seen as much of the world as I want to, I\u2019d like to settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose. I\u2019m to be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me. And I\u2019m never to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live for what I like. That\u2019s my favorite castle. What\u2019s yours, Meg?\u201d", "Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said slowly, \u201cI should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of luxurious things\u2014nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people, and heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit. How I should enjoy it! For I wouldn\u2019t be idle, but do good, and make everyone love me dearly.\u201d", "\u201cWouldn\u2019t you have a master for your castle in the air?\u201d asked Laurie slyly.", "\u201cI said \u2018pleasant people\u2019, you know,\u201d and Meg carefully tied up her shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.", "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say you\u2019d have a splendid, wise, good husband and some angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn\u2019t be perfect without,\u201d said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather scorned romance, except in books.", "\u201cYou\u2019d have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,\u201d answered Meg petulantly. \u201cWouldn\u2019t I though?

I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous, that would suit me, so that is my favorite dream.\u201d", "\u201cMine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take care of the family,\u201d said Beth contentedly.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you wish for anything else?\u201d asked Laurie.", "\u201cSince I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we may all keep well and be together, nothing else.\u201d", "\u201cI have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole world,\u201d was Amy\u2019s modest desire.", "\u201cWe\u2019re an ambitious set, aren\u2019t we?

How old I shall be, twenty-seven!\u201d exclaimed Meg, who felt grown up already, having just reached seventeen.", "\u201cYou and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy twenty-two. What a venerable party!\u201d said Jo.", "\u201cI hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but I\u2019m such a lazy dog, I\u2019m afraid I shall dawdle, Jo.\u201d", "\u201cYou need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is sure you\u2019ll work splendidly.\u201d", "\u201cIs she? By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!\u201d cried Laurie, sitting up with sudden energy. \u201cI ought to be satisfied to please Grandfather, and I do try, but it\u2019s working against the grain, you see, and comes hard. He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and I\u2019d rather be shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, and I don\u2019t care how soon they go to the bottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business. But he\u2019s set, and I\u2019ve got to do just as", "he did, unless I break away and please myself, as my father did. If there was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman, I\u2019d do it tomorrow.\u201d", "Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man\u2019s hatred of subjection, a young man\u2019s restless longing to try the world for himself.", "\u201cI advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home again till you have tried your own way,\u201d said Jo, whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was excited by what she called \u2018Teddy\u2019s Wrongs\u2019.", "\u201cThat\u2019s not right, Jo. You mustn\u2019t talk in that way, and Laurie mustn\u2019t take your bad advice. You should do just what your grandfather wishes, my dear boy,\u201d said Meg in her most maternal tone. \u201cDo your best at college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be hard on you or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with and love him, and you\u2019d never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission. Don\u2019t be dismal or fret, but do your duty and you\u2019ll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved.\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d asked Laurie, grateful for the good advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak.", "\u201cOnly what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his own mother till she died, and wouldn\u2019t go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldn\u2019t leave her. And how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be.\u201d", "\u201cSo he is, dear old fellow!\u201d said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story. \u201cIt\u2019s like Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn\u2019t understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you all in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I\u2019ll do for Brooke.\u201d", "\u201cBegin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,\u201d said Meg sharply. \u201cHow do you know I do, Miss?\u201d", "\u201cI can always tell by his face when he goes away. If you have been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly. If you have plagued him, he\u2019s sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work better.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I like that? So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in Brooke\u2019s face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he passes your window, but I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d got up a telegraph.\u201d", "\u201cWe haven\u2019t. Don\u2019t be angry, and oh, don\u2019t tell him I said anything! It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here is said in confidence, you know,\u201d cried Meg, much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech.", "\u201cI don\u2019t tell tales,\u201d replied Laurie, with his \u2018high and mighty\u2019 air, as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. \u201cOnly if Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather for him to report.\u201d", "\u201cPlease don\u2019t be offended. I didn\u2019t mean to preach or tell tales or be silly. I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you\u2019d be sorry for by-and-by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.\u201d And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.", "Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand, and said frankly, \u201cI\u2019m the one to be forgiven. I\u2019m cross and have been out of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly, so don\u2019t mind if I am grumpy sometimes. I thank you all the same.\u201d", "Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a fit person to belong to the \u2018Busy Bee Society\u2019. In the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea \u2018to draw\u2019, and they would just have time to get home to supper.", "\u201cMay I come again?\u201d asked Laurie.", "\u201cYes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are told to do,\u201d said Meg, smiling.", "\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d", "\u201cThen you may come, and I\u2019ll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do. There\u2019s a demand for socks just now,\u201d added Jo, waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.", "That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie, standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David, whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully, \u201cI\u2019ll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.\u201d", "Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow chilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa, writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her, while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen, exclaiming...", "\u201cThere, I\u2019ve done my best! If this won\u2019t suit I shall have to wait till I can do better.\u201d", "Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through, making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points, which looked like little balloons. Then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo\u2019s desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall. In it she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves. From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.", "She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road. Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.", "If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street. Having found the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came. This maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake, pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out.", "There was a dentist\u2019s sign, among others, which adorned the entrance, and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, \u201cIt\u2019s like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she\u2019ll need someone to help her home.\u201d", "In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod. But he followed, asking with an air of sympathy, \u201cDid you have a bad time?\u201d", "\u201cNot very.\u201d", "\u201cYou got through quickly.\u201d \u201cYes, thank goodness!\u201d \u201cWhy did you go alone?\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?\u201d", "Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something.", "\u201cThere are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo,\u201d said Laurie, looking mystified. \u201cSo are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?\u201d", "\u201cBegging your pardon, ma\u2019am, it wasn\u2019t a billiard saloon, but a gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m glad of that.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d", "\u201cYou can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and we\u2019ll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.\u201d", "Laurie burst out with a hearty boy\u2019s laugh, which made several passers-by smile in spite of themselves.", "\u201cI\u2019ll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not. It\u2019s grand fun and will straighten you up capitally. But I don\u2019t believe that was your only reason for saying \u2018I\u2019m glad\u2019 in that decided way, was it now?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you never go to such places.", "Do you?\u201d \u201cNot often.\u201d", "\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it\u2019s no fun unless you have good players, so, as I\u2019m fond of it, I come sometimes and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows.\u201d \u201cOh, dear, I\u2019m so sorry, for you\u2019ll get to liking it better and better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. I did hope you\u2019d stay respectable and be a", "satisfaction to your friends,\u201d said Jo, shaking her head.", "\u201cCan\u2019t a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability?\u201d asked Laurie, looking nettled.", "\u201cThat depends upon how and where he takes it. I don\u2019t like Ned and his set, and wish you\u2019d keep out of it. Mother won\u2019t let us have him at our house, though he wants to come. And if you grow like him she won\u2019t be willing to have us frolic together as we do now.\u201d", "\u201cWon\u2019t she?\u201d asked Laurie anxiously.", "\u201cNo, she can\u2019t bear fashionable young men, and she\u2019d shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them.\u201d", "\u201cWell, she needn\u2019t get out her bandboxes yet. I\u2019m not a fashionable party and don\u2019t mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and then, don\u2019t you?\u201d", "\u201cYes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don\u2019t get wild, will you? Or there will be an end of all our good times.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll be a double distilled saint.\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t bear saints. Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and we\u2019ll never desert you. I don\u2019t know what I should do if you acted like Mr. King\u2019s son. He had plenty of money, but didn\u2019t know how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his father\u2019s name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.\u201d", "\u201cYou think I\u2019m likely to do the same? Much obliged.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u2014oh, dear, no!\u2014but I hear people talking about money being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor.

Fire away.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I\u2019ve left two stories with a newspaperman, and he\u2019s to give his answer next week,\u201d whispered Jo, in her confidant\u2019s ear.", "\u201cHurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!\u201d cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children, for they were out of the city now.", "\u201cHush! It won\u2019t come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn\u2019t rest till I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn\u2019t want anyone else to be disappointed.\u201d", "\u201cIt won\u2019t fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won\u2019t it be fun to see them in print, and shan\u2019t we feel proud of our authoress?\u201d", "Jo\u2019s eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a friend\u2019s praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.", "\u201cWhere\u2019s your secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I\u2019ll never believe you again,\u201d she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement.", "\u201cI may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn\u2019t promise not to, so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I\u2019ve told you any plummy bit of news I get. I know where Meg\u2019s glove is.\u201d", "\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.", "\u201cIt\u2019s quite enough for the present, as you\u2019ll agree when I tell you where it is.\u201d \u201cTell, then.\u201d", "Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo\u2019s ear, which produced a comical change. She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d", "\u201cSaw it.\u201d", "\u201cWhere?\u201d", "\u201cPocket.\u201d", "\u201cAll this time?\u201d", "\u201cYes, isn\u2019t that romantic?\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s horrid.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d", "\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. It\u2019s ridiculous, it won\u2019t be allowed. My patience! What would Meg say?\u201d \u201cYou are not to tell anyone. Mind that.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t promise.\u201d", "\u201cThat was understood, and I trusted you.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I won\u2019t for the present, anyway, but I\u2019m disgusted, and wish you hadn\u2019t told me.\u201d", "\u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d", "\u201cAt the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see anyone try it,\u201d cried Jo fiercely.", "\u201cSo should I!\u201d and Laurie chuckled at the idea.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that,\u201d said Jo rather ungratefully.", "\u201cRace down this hill with me, and you\u2019ll be all right,\u201d suggested Laurie.", "No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.", "\u201cI wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air, and not lose my breath. It was capital, but see what a guy it\u2019s made me. Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are,\u201d said Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.", "Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again. But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls.", "\u201cWhat in the world are you doing here?\u201d she asked, regarding her disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.", "\u201cGetting leaves,\u201d meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up.", "\u201cAnd hairpins,\u201d added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo\u2019s lap. \u201cThey grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats.\u201d", "\u201cYou have been running, Jo. How could you? When will you stop such romping ways?\u201d said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.", "\u201cNever till I\u2019m stiff and old and have to use a crutch. Don\u2019t try to make me grow up before my time, Meg. It\u2019s hard enough to have you change all of a sudden. Let me be a little girl as long as I can.\u201d", "As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman, and Laurie\u2019s secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near. He saw the trouble in her face and drew Meg\u2019s attention from it by asking quickly, \u201cWhere have you been calling, all so fine?\u201d", "\u201cAt the Gardiners\u2019, and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle Moffat\u2019s wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend the winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be!\u201d", "\u201cDo you envy her, Meg?\u201d said Laurie. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I do.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m glad of it!\u201d muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Meg, looking surprised.", "\u201cBecause if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a poor man,\u201d said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to mind what she said.", "\u201cI shall never \u2018go and marry\u2019 anyone,\u201d observed Meg, walking on with great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping stones, and \u2018behaving like children\u2019, as Meg said to herself, though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on.", "For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered. She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner. Laurie and she were always making signs to one another, and talking about \u2018Spread Eagles\u2019 till the girls declared they had both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in Amy\u2019s bower. What went on there, Meg could not see, but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers.", "\u201cWhat shall we do with that girl? She never will behave like a young lady,\u201d sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.", "\u201cI hope she won\u2019t. She is so funny and dear as she is,\u201d said Beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo\u2019s having secrets with anyone but her.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very trying, but we never can make her commy la fo,\u201d added Amy, who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a very becoming way, two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike.", "In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected to read. \u201cHave you anything interesting there?\u201d asked Meg, with condescension.", "\u201cNothing but a story, won\u2019t amount to much, I guess,\u201d returned Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.", "\u201cYou\u2019d better read it aloud. That will amuse us and keep you out of mischief,\u201d said Amy in her most grown-up tone.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the name?\u201d asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind the sheet. \u201cThe Rival Painters.\u201d", "\u201cThat sounds well. Read it,\u201d said Meg.", "With a loud \u201cHem!\u201d and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast. The girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. \u201cI like that about the splendid picture,\u201d was Amy\u2019s approving remark, as Jo paused.", "\u201cI prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite names, isn\u2019t that queer?\u201d said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the lovering part was tragical.", "\u201cWho wrote it?\u201d asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo\u2019s face.", "The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice, \u201cYour sister.\u201d", "\u201cYou?\u201d cried Meg, dropping her work. \u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d said Amy critically.", "\u201cI knew it! I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!\u201d and Beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success.", "Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! How Meg wouldn\u2019t believe it till she saw the words. \u201cMiss Josephine March,\u201d actually printed in the paper. How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately couldn\u2019t be carried", "out, as the hero and heroine were dead. How Beth got excited, and skipped and sang with joy. How Hannah came in to exclaim, \u201cSakes alive, well I never!\u201d in great astonishment at \u2018that Jo\u2019s doin\u2019s\u2019. How proud Mrs. March was when she knew it. How Jo laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it, and how the \u2018Spread Eagle\u2019 might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to hand.", "\u201cTell us about it.\u201d \u201cWhen did it come?\u201d \u201cHow much did you get for it?\u201d \u201cWhat will Father say?\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t Laurie laugh?\u201d cried the family, all in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy.", "\u201cStop jabbering, girls, and I\u2019ll tell you everything,\u201d said Jo, wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did over her \u2018Rival Painters\u2019. Having told how she disposed of her tales, Jo added, \u201cAnd when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them both, but didn\u2019t pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and noticed the stories. It was good practice, he said, and when the beginners improved, anyone would pay. So I let him have the two stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him. And he said it was good, and I shall write more, and he\u2019s going to get the next paid for, and I am so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls.\u201d", "Jo\u2019s breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end.", "\u201cNovember is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,\u201d said Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking out at the frostbitten garden.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I was born in it,\u201d observed Jo pensively, quite unconscious of the blot on her nose.", "\u201cIf something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a delightful month,\u201d said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything, even November.", "\u201cI dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family,\u201d said Meg, who was out of sorts. \u201cWe go grubbing along day after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun. We might as well be in a treadmill.\u201d", "\u201cMy patience, how blue we are!\u201d cried Jo. \u201cI don\u2019t much wonder, poor dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you grind, grind, year in and year out. Oh, don\u2019t I wish I could manage things for you as I do for my heroines! You\u2019re pretty enough and good enough already, so I\u2019d have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly. Then you\u2019d dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance.\u201d", "\u201cPeople don\u2019t have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have to work and women marry for money. It\u2019s a dreadfully unjust world,\u201d said Meg bitterly.", "\u201cJo and I are going to make fortunes for you all. Just wait ten years, and see if we don\u2019t,\u201d said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.", "\u201cCan\u2019t wait, and I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t much faith in ink and dirt, though I\u2019m grateful for your good intentions.\u201d", "Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again. Jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window, said, smiling, \u201cTwo pleasant things are going to happen right away. Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell.\u201d", "In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, \u201cAny letter from Father, girls?\u201d and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, \u201cWon\u2019t some of you come for a drive? I\u2019ve been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle, and I\u2019m going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn. It\u2019s a dull day, but the air isn\u2019t bad, and I\u2019m going to take Brooke home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn\u2019t out. Come, Jo, you and Beth will go, won\u2019t you?\u201d", "\u201cOf course we will.\u201d", "\u201cMuch obliged, but I\u2019m busy.\u201d And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not to drive too often with the young gentleman.", "\u201cWe three will be ready in a minute,\u201d cried Amy, running away to wash her hands.", "\u201cCan I do anything for you, Madam Mother?\u201d asked Laurie, leaning over Mrs. March\u2019s chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her.", "\u201cNo, thank you, except call at the office, if you\u2019ll be so kind, dear. It\u2019s our day for a letter, and the postman hasn\u2019t been. Father is as regular as the sun, but there\u2019s some delay on the way, perhaps.\u201d", "A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a letter.", "\u201cIt\u2019s one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,\u201d she said, handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.", "At the word \u2018telegraph\u2019, Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed downstairs for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a frightened voice...", "Mrs. March:", "Your husband is very ill. Come at once.", "Blank Hospital, Washington.", "How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them.", "Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never forgot, \u201cI shall go at once, but it may be too late. Oh, children, children, help me to bear it!\u201d", "For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears. Poor Hannah was the first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example, for with her, work was panacea for most afflictions.", "\u201cThe Lord keep the dear man! I won\u2019t waste no time a-cryin\u2019, but git your things ready right away, mum,\u201d she said heartily, as she wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.", "\u201cShe\u2019s right, there\u2019s no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and let me think.\u201d", "They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.", "\u201cWhere\u2019s Laurie?\u201d she asked presently, when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.", "\u201cHere, ma\u2019am. Oh, let me do something!\u201d cried the boy, hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see. \u201cSend a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train goes early in the morning. I\u2019ll take", "that.\u201d", "\u201cWhat else? The horses are ready. I can go anywhere, do anything,\u201d he said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.", "\u201cLeave a note at Aunt March\u2019s. Jo, give me that pen and paper.\u201d", "Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to add a little to the sum for her father.", "\u201cNow go, dear, but don\u2019t kill yourself driving at a desperate pace. There is no need of that.\u201d", "Mrs. March\u2019s warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his life.", "\u201cJo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can\u2019t come. On the way get these things. I\u2019ll put them down, they\u2019ll be needed and I must go prepared for nursing. Hospital stores are not always good. Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine. I\u2019m not too proud to beg for Father. He shall have the best of everything. Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and Meg, come and help me find my things, for I\u2019m half bewildered.\u201d", "Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while, and let them work. Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell.", "Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mother\u2019s absence, which comforted her very much. There was nothing he didn\u2019t offer, from his own dressing gown to himself as escort. But the last was impossible. Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman\u2019s undertaking the long journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it, for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he\u2019d be back directly. No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.", "\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,\u201d he said, in the kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit. \u201cI came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there.\u201d", "Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take.", "\u201cHow kind you all are! Mother will accept, I\u2019m sure, and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her. Thank you very, very much!\u201d", "Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.", "Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time. Mrs. March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she had been there.", "The short afternoon wore away. All other errands were done, and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a \u2018slap and a bang\u2019, but still Jo did not come. They began to get anxious, and Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take into her head. He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a little choke in her voice, \u201cThat\u2019s my contribution toward making Father comfortable and bringing him home!\u201d", "\u201cMy dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope you haven\u2019t done anything rash?\u201d", "\u201cNo, it\u2019s mine honestly. I didn\u2019t beg, borrow, or steal it. I earned it, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.\u201d", "As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.", "\u201cYour hair! Your beautiful hair!\u201d \u201cOh, Jo, how could you? Your one beauty.\u201d \u201cMy dear girl, there was no need of this.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!\u201d", "As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle, and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect the fate of the nation, so don\u2019t wail, Beth. It will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig. It will do my brains good to have that mop taken off. My head feels deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order. I\u2019m satisfied, so please take the money and let\u2019s have supper.\u201d", "\u201cTell me all about it, Jo. I am not quite satisfied, but I can\u2019t blame you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call it, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I\u2019m afraid you will regret it one of these days,\u201d said Mrs. March.", "\u201cNo, I won\u2019t!\u201d returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned.", "\u201cWhat made you do it?\u201d asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair.", "\u201cWell, I was wild to do something for Father,\u201d replied Jo, as they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble. \u201cI hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence. Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money, if I sold the nose off my face to get it.\u201d", "\u201cYou needn\u2019t feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings,\u201d said Mrs. March with a look that warmed Jo\u2019s heart.", "\u201cI hadn\u2019t the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I\u2019d like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a barber\u2019s window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars. It came to me all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for mine.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t see how you dared to do it,\u201d said Beth in a tone of awe.", "\u201cOh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair. He rather stared at first, as if he wasn\u2019t used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. He said he didn\u2019t care about mine, it wasn\u2019t the fashionable color, and he never paid much for it in the first place. The work put into it made it dear, and so on. It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn\u2019t done right away that I shouldn\u2019t have it done at all, and you know when I start to do a thing, I hate to give it up. So I begged him to take it, and told him why I was in such a hurry. It was silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, \u2018Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady. I\u2019d do as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.\u201d", "\u201cWho was Jimmy?\u201d asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they went along.", "\u201cHer son, she said, who was in the army. How friendly such things make strangers feel, don\u2019t they? She talked away all the time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.\u201d", "\u201cDidn\u2019t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?\u201d asked Meg, with a shiver.", "\u201cI took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that was the end of it. I never snivel over trifles like that. I will confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost seemed as if I\u2019d an arm or leg off. The woman saw me look at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep. I\u2019ll give it to you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don\u2019t think I shall ever have a mane again.\u201d", "Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk. She only said, \u201cThank you, deary,\u201d but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke\u2019s kindness, the prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to be nursed.", "No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o\u2019clock Mrs. March put by the last finished job, and said, \u201cCome girls.\u201d Beth went to the piano and played the father\u2019s favorite hymn. All began bravely, but broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler.", "\u201cGo to bed and don\u2019t talk, for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get. Good night, my darlings,\u201d said Mrs. March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.", "They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room. Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life. Jo lay motionless, and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...", "\u201cJo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father?\u201d \u201cNo, not now.\u201d", "\u201cWhat then?\u201d", "\u201cMy... My hair!\u201d burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow.", "It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.", "\u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d protested Jo, with a choke. \u201cI\u2019d do it again tomorrow, if I could. It\u2019s only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way. Don\u2019t tell anyone, it\u2019s all over now. I thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my one beauty. How came you to be awake?\u201d", "\u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m so anxious,\u201d said Meg.", "\u201cThink about something pleasant, and you\u2019ll soon drop off.\u201d \u201cI tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you think of?\u201d", "\u201cHandsome faces\u2014eyes particularly,\u201d answered Meg, smiling to herself in the dark. \u201cWhat color do you like best?\u201d", "\u201cBrown, that is, sometimes. Blue are lovely.\u201d", "Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air.", "The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here, settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter. As she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face, which seemed to whisper in the silence, \u201cBe comforted, dear soul! There is always light behind the clouds.\u201d", "In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before. For now the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within. Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah\u2019s familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother\u2019s cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution. Meg\u2019s eyes kept filling in spite of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the", "kitchen roller more than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.", "Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag...", "\u201cChildren, I leave you to Hannah\u2019s care and Mr. Laurence\u2019s protection. Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don\u2019t grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless.\u201d", "\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d", "\u201cMeg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don\u2019t get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to help and cheer all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and you, Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.\u201d", "\u201cWe will, Mother! We will!\u201d", "The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well. No one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.", "Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him \u2018Mr. Greatheart\u2019 on the spot.", "\u201cGood-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!\u201d whispered Mrs. March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried into the carriage.", "As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it also, and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.", "\u201cHow kind everyone is to us!\u201d she said, turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man\u2019s face.", "\u201cI don\u2019t see how they can help it,\u201d returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.", "\u201cI feel as if there had been an earthquake,\u201d said Jo, as their neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.", "\u201cIt seems as if half the house was gone,\u201d added Meg forlornly.", "Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother\u2019s table, showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It was a little thing, but it went straight to their hearts, and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.", "Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with a coffeepot.", "\u201cNow, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don\u2019t fret. Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let\u2019s fall to work and be a credit to the family.\u201d", "Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. They drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes were all right again.", "\u201c\u2018Hope and keep busy\u2019, that\u2019s the motto for us, so let\u2019s see who will remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won\u2019t she lecture though!\u201d said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.", "\u201cI shall go to my Kings, though I\u2019d much rather stay at home and attend to things here,\u201d said Meg, wishing she hadn\u2019t made her eyes so red.", "\u201cNo need of that. Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,\u201d put in Amy, with an important air. \u201cHannah will tell us what to do, and we\u2019ll have everything nice when you come home,\u201d added", "Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub without delay.", "\u201cI think anxiety is very interesting,\u201d observed Amy, eating sugar pensively.", "The girls couldn\u2019t help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl.", "The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother\u2019s face. It was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin.", "\u201cThat\u2019s so like my Beth!\u201d said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face. \u201cGoodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won\u2019t strain today.

Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which grew more cheerful as the week passed. At first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and read them.", "My dearest Mother:", "It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for the news was so good we couldn\u2019t help laughing and crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence\u2019s business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father. The girls are all as good as gold.

Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint. She does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We are all well and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...", "This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed letters.", "My precious Marmee:", "Three cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off, and let us know the minute he was better.

I\u2019m glad!\u201d Didn\u2019t that do as well as a regular prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so desperately good, it\u2019s like living in a nest of turtledoves. You\u2019d laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I\u2019m in love with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I\u2014well, I\u2019m Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn\u2019t speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn\u2019t come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn\u2019t and got mad. It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it\u2019s hard to beg pardon. But I thought he\u2019d come to it, for I was in the right. He didn\u2019t come, and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the same thing.

I told Mother I\u2019d do the errands, and I haven\u2019t,\u201d said Jo decidedly.", "\u201cWhich will you have, Beth? There ain\u2019t no need of but one,\u201d aid Hannah.", "\u201cJo, please.\u201d And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look, which effectually settled that point.", "\u201cI\u2019ll go and tell Amy,\u201d said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.", "Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, and commanded, all in vain. Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head in the sofa cushions. She told her story, expecting to be consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, \u201cNow be a sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don\u2019t cry, but hear what a jolly plan I\u2019ve got. You go to Aunt March\u2019s, and I\u2019ll come and take you out every day, driving or walking, and we\u2019ll have capital times. Won\u2019t that be better than moping here?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,\u201d began Amy, in an injured voice. \u201cBless your heart, child, it\u2019s to keep you well. You don\u2019t want to be sick, do you?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t, but I dare say I shall be, for I\u2019ve been with Beth all the time.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss.\u201d", "\u201cBut it\u2019s dull at Aunt March\u2019s, and she is so cross,\u201d said Amy, looking rather frightened.", "\u201cIt won\u2019t be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is, and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I\u2019ll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won\u2019t peck at us, whatever we do.\u201d", "\u201cWill you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?\u201d \u201cOn my honor as a gentleman.\u201d", "\u201cAnd come every single day?\u201d \u201cSee if I don\u2019t!\u201d", "\u201cAnd bring me back the minute Beth is well?\u201d \u201cThe identical minute.\u201d", "\u201cAnd go to the theater, truly?\u201d \u201cA dozen theaters, if we may.\u201d", "\u201cWell\u2014I guess I will,\u201d said Amy slowly.", "\u201cGood girl! Call Meg, and tell her you\u2019ll give in,\u201d said Laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the \u2018giving in\u2019.", "Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.", "\u201cHow is the little dear?\u201d asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.", "\u201cShe is lying down on Mother\u2019s bed, and feels better. The baby\u2019s death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,\u201d answered Meg.", "\u201cWhat a trying world it is!\u201d said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful way. \u201cNo sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother\u2019s gone, so I\u2019m all at sea.\u201d", "\u201cWell, don\u2019t make a porcupine of yourself, it isn\u2019t becoming. Settle your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do anything?\u201d asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friend\u2019s one beauty.", "\u201cThat is what troubles me,\u201d said Meg. \u201cI think we ought to tell her if Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn\u2019t, for Mother can\u2019t leave Father, and it will only make them anxious. Beth won\u2019t be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn\u2019t seem quite right to me.\u201d", "\u201cHum, well, I can\u2019t say. Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor has been.\u201d", "\u201cWe will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,\u201d commanded Meg. \u201cWe can\u2019t decide anything till he has been.\u201d", "\u201cStay where you are, Jo. I\u2019m errand boy to this establishment,\u201d said Laurie, taking up his cap. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you are busy,\u201d began Meg.", "\u201cNo, I\u2019ve done my lessons for the day.\u201d \u201cDo you study in vacation time?\u201d asked Jo.", "\u201cI follow the good example my neighbors set me,\u201d was Laurie\u2019s answer, as he swung himself out of the room.", "\u201cI have great hopes for my boy,\u201d observed Jo, watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile.", "\u201cHe does very well, for a boy,\u201d was Meg\u2019s somewhat ungracious answer, for the subject did not interest her.", "Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story. Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.", "Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.", "\u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles, while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out...", "\u201cGo away. No boys allowed here.\u201d", "Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.", "\u201cNo more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn\u2019t sick, which I\u2019ve no doubt she will be, looks like it now. Don\u2019t cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff.\u201d", "Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot\u2019s tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out, \u201cBless my boots!\u201d in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.", "\u201cWhat do you hear from your mother?\u201d asked the old lady gruffly. \u201cFather is much better,\u201d replied Jo, trying to keep sober.", "\u201cOh, is he? Well, that won\u2019t last long, I fancy. March never had any stamina,\u201d was the cheerful reply.", "\u201cHa, ha! Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!\u201d squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady\u2019s cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.", "\u201cHold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! And, Jo, you\u2019d better go at once. It isn\u2019t proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like...\u201d", "\u201cHold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!\u201d cried Polly, tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the \u2018rattlepated\u2019 boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think I can bear it, but I\u2019ll try,\u201d thought Amy, as she was left alone with Aunt March. \u201cGet along, you fright!\u201d screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy could not restrain a sniff.", "Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of Beth\u2019s illness. She could not think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn\u2019t hear of \u2018Mrs. March bein\u2019 told, and worried just for sech a trifle.\u2019", "Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself. But there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she \u2018would think of it, though there was no danger yet\u2019. A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a long while.", "How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buy\u2014in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of Beth\u2019s nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth\u2019s unselfish ambition to live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. Everyone missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little Beth had made.", "Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege. She longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth\u2019s side.", "The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low voice to Hannah, \u201cIf Mrs. March can leave her husband she\u2019d better be sent for.\u201d", "Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly, \u201cWhat is it? Is Beth worse?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve sent for Mother,\u201d said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression.", "\u201cGood for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?\u201d asked Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook.", "\u201cNo. The doctor told us to.\u201d", "\u201cOh, Jo, it\u2019s not so bad as that?\u201d cried Laurie, with a startled face.", "\u201cYes, it is. She doesn\u2019t know us, she doesn\u2019t even talk about the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. She doesn\u2019t look like my Beth, and there\u2019s nobody to help us bear it. Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can\u2019t find Him.\u201d", "As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo\u2019s cheeks, she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat, \u201cI\u2019m here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!\u201d", "She could not speak, but she did \u2018hold on\u2019, and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble.", "Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful face.", "\u201cThank you, Teddy, I\u2019m better now. I don\u2019t feel so forlorn, and will try to bear it if it comes.\u201d \u201cKeep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo. Soon your mother will be here, and then", "everything will be all right.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m so glad Father is better. Now she won\u2019t feel so bad about leaving him. Oh, me! It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,\u201d sighed Jo, spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.", "\u201cDoesn\u2019t Meg pull fair?\u201d asked Laurie, looking indignant.", "\u201cOh, yes, she tries to, but she can\u2019t love Bethy as I do, and she won\u2019t miss her as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I can\u2019t give her up. I can\u2019t! I can\u2019t!\u201d", "Down went Jo\u2019s face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It might be unmanly, but he couldn\u2019t help it, and I am glad of it. Presently, as Jo\u2019s sobs quieted, he said hopefully, \u201cI don\u2019t think she will die. She\u2019s so good, and we all love her so much, I don\u2019t believe God will take her away yet.\u201d", "\u201cThe good and dear people always do die,\u201d groaned Jo, but she stopped crying, for her friend\u2019s words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears.", "\u201cPoor girl, you\u2019re worn out. It isn\u2019t like you to be forlorn. Stop a bit. I\u2019ll hearten you up in a jiffy.\u201d Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down on Beth\u2019s little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, \u201cI drink\u2014 Health to my Beth! You are a good doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend. How can I ever pay you?\u201d she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words", "had done her troubled mind.", "\u201cI\u2019ll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I\u2019ll give you something that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,\u201d said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something.", "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.", "\u201cI telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she\u2019d come at once, and she\u2019ll be here tonight, and everything will be all right. Aren\u2019t you glad I did it?\u201d", "Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, \u201cOh, Laurie! Oh, Mother! I am so glad!\u201d She did not weep again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news.", "Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind. He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying breathlessly, \u201cOh, don\u2019t! I didn\u2019t mean to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn\u2019t help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don\u2019t give me wine again, it makes me act so.\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. \u201cWhy, you see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought to know. She\u2019d never forgive us if Beth... Well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram. I never can bear to be \u2018lorded over\u2019, so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in at two A.M. I shall go for her, and you\u2019ve only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here.\u201d", "\u201cLaurie, you\u2019re an angel! How shall I ever thank you?\u201d", "\u201cFly at me again. I rather liked it,\u201d said Laurie, looking mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.", "\u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don\u2019t tease, but go home and rest, for you\u2019ll be up half the night. Bless you, Teddy, bless you!\u201d", "Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was \u201chappy, oh, so happy!\u201d while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away,\u201d said Hannah, with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news.", "Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah \u201cknocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected\u201d. A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change. Beth\u2019s bird began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy\u2019s bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness, and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, \u201cMother\u2019s coming, dear! Mother\u2019s coming!\u201d Every one rejoiced but Beth. She lay in that heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter, \u201cWater!\u201d with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word. All day Jo", "and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged slowly by. But night came at last, and every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that some change, for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which time he would return.", "Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed\u2019s foot and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March\u2019s countenance as she entered. Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.", "The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.", "\u201cIf God spares Beth, I never will complain again,\u201d whispered Meg earnestly.", "\u201cIf God spares Beth, I\u2019ll try to love and serve Him all my life,\u201d answered Jo, with equal fervor. \u201cI wish I had no heart, it aches so,\u201d sighed Meg, after a pause.", "\u201cIf life is often as hard as this, I don\u2019t see how we ever shall get through it,\u201d added her sister despondently.", "Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie\u2019s quiet departure for the station. Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls.", "It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother\u2019s easy chair with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as she thought, \u201cBeth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.\u201d", "She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, \u201cGood-by, my Beth. Good-by!\u201d", "As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, \u201cThe fever\u2019s turned, she\u2019s sleepin\u2019 nat\u2019ral, her skin\u2019s damp, and she breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh, my goodness me!\u201d", "Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to confirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, \u201cYes, my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her...\u201d", "What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words. When they went back to be", "kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.", "\u201cIf Mother would only come now!\u201d said Jo, as the winter night began to wane.", "\u201cSee,\u201d said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, \u201cI thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth\u2019s hand tomorrow if she\u2014went away from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little rose, and Mother\u2019s face.\u201d", "Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.", "\u201cIt looks like a fairy world,\u201d said Meg, smiling to herself, as she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.", "\u201cHark!\u201d cried Jo, starting to her feet.", "Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah, and then Laurie\u2019s voice saying in a joyful whisper, \u201cGirls, she\u2019s come! She\u2019s come!\u201d", "While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at Aunt March\u2019s. She felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew\u2019s children, though she didn\u2019t think it proper to confess it. She really did her best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize with children\u2019s little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy\u2019s soul, and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.", "She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone. Then she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was. Not a speck escaped Aunt March\u2019s eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly had to be fed, the lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair. After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play, and didn\u2019t she enjoy it?", "Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times. After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit", "still while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime. The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.", "If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time. The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird. Then she could not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady.", "Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with \u2018Madame\u2019, as she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change her religion. She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame\u2019s laces. She also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy\u2019s chief delight was an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover\u2019s diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March\u2019s big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March\u2019s wedding ring, too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all.", "\u201cWhich would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?\u201d asked Esther, who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.", "\u201cI like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I\u2019m fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose this if I might,\u201d replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.", "\u201cI, too, covet that, but not as a necklace. Ah, no! To me it is a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic,\u201d said Esther, eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.", "\u201cIs it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads hanging over your glass?\u201d asked Amy.", "\u201cTruly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.\u201d", "\u201cYou seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could.\u201d", "\u201cIf Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort, but as that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame. She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble.\u201d", "\u201cWould it be right for me to do so too?\u201d asked Amy, who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind her of it.", "\u201cIt would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.\u201d", "Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.", "\u201cI wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March dies,\u201d she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one.", "\u201cTo you and your sisters. I know it, Madame confides in me. I witnessed her will, and it is to be so,\u201d whispered Esther smiling.", "\u201cHow nice! But I wish she\u2019d let us have them now. Procrastination is not agreeable,\u201d observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.", "\u201cIt is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said it, and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners.\u201d", "\u201cDo you think so? Oh, I\u2019ll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely ring! It\u2019s ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant\u2019s. I do like Aunt March after all.\u201d And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it.", "From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor care if she did. It was, however, a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy\u2019s beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart. On the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every day to \u2018sit alone\u2019 thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to preserve her sister. Esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.", "The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children. She missed her mother\u2019s help to understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly. But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her", "burden seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will, as Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old lady\u2019s jewels.", "During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she did not hear Laurie\u2019s ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, \u201cAin\u2019t we fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha! Ha!\u201d", "Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.", "\u201cSit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to consult you about a very serious matter,\u201d said Amy, when she had shown her splendor and driven Polly into a corner. \u201cThat bird is the trial of my life,\u201d she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.", "\u201cYesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went to let him out, and found a big spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase. Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, \u2018Come out and take a walk, my dear.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t help laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.\u201d", "\u201cDid the spider accept the old fellow\u2019s invitation?\u201d asked Laurie, yawning.", "\u201cYes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and scrambled up on Aunt\u2019s chair, calling out, \u2018Catch her! Catch her! Catch her!\u2019 as I chased the spider.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s a lie! Oh, lor!\u201d cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie\u2019s toes.", "\u201cI\u2019d wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,\u201d cried Laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely croaked, \u201cAllyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!\u201d", "\u201cNow I\u2019m ready,\u201d said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket. \u201cI want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is legal and right. I felt I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and I don\u2019t want any ill feeling over my tomb.\u201d", "Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the spelling:", "I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all my earthly property\u2014viz. to wit:\u2014namely", "To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he likes with.", "To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets\u2014also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.", "To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her \u2018little girl\u2019.", "To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my bronze inkstand\u2014she lost the cover\u2014and my most precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.", "To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being thin when she gets well. And I herewith also leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.", "To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn\u2019t any neck. Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.", "To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family, especially Beth.", "I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.", "To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave hoping she \u2018will remember me, when it you see\u2019.", "And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead. I forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. Amen.", "To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.", "Amy Curtis March Witnesses:", "Estelle Valnor, Theodore Laurence.", "The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.", "\u201cWhat put it into your head? Did anyone tell you about Beth\u2019s giving away her things?\u201d asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.", "She explained and then asked anxiously, \u201cWhat about Beth?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I spoke, but as I did, I\u2019ll tell you. She felt so ill one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her", "sake. She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of us, and her best love to Grandpa. She never thought of a will.\u201d", "Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper. Amy\u2019s face was full of trouble, but she only said, \u201cDon\u2019t people put sort of postscripts to their wills, sometimes?\u201d", "\u201cYes, \u2018codicils\u2019, they call them.\u201d", "\u201cPut one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and given round to my friends. I forgot it, but I want it done though it will spoil my looks.\u201d", "Laurie added it, smiling at Amy\u2019s last and greatest sacrifice. Then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips, \u201cIs there really any danger about Beth?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don\u2019t cry, dear.\u201d And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting.", "When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart, feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister.", "I don\u2019t think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters. Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg\u2019s tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and Mother\u2019s face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep.", "Hannah had \u2018dished up\u2019 an astonishing breakfast for the traveler, finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened to her whispered account of Father\u2019s state, Mr. Brooke\u2019s promise to stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie\u2019s hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.", "What a strange yet pleasant day that was. So brilliant and gay without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow. So quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching, and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave Beth\u2019s side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered treasure.", "Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well that Aunt March actually \u2018sniffed\u2019 herself, and never once said \u201cI told you so\u201d. Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried", "her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie\u2019s opinion, that she behaved \u2018like a capital little woman\u2019. Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl, blessed her buttons, and begged her to \u201ccome and take a walk, dear\u201d, in his most affable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.", "After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till night, and I\u2019m not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by Amy\u2019s cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her mother\u2019s lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.", "\u201cOn the contrary, I like it very much, dear,\u201d looking from the dusty rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen. \u201cIt is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this.\u201d", "\u201cYes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I\u2019ve tried to make. The woman\u2019s face is not good, it\u2019s too beautiful for me to draw, but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to think He was a little child once, for then I don\u2019t seem so far away, and that helps me.\u201d", "As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother\u2019s knee, Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. She said nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute\u2019s pause, she added gravely, \u201cI wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the ring today. She called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she\u2019d like to keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it\u2019s too big. I\u2019d like to wear them Mother, can I?\u201d", "\u201cThey are very pretty, but I think you\u2019re rather too young for such ornaments, Amy,\u201d said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.", "\u201cI\u2019ll try not to be vain,\u201d said Amy. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like it only because it\u2019s so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet, to remind me of something.\u201d", "\u201cDo you mean Aunt March?\u201d asked her mother, laughing.", "\u201cNo, to remind me not to be selfish.\u201d Amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to the little plan.", "\u201cI\u2019ve thought a great deal lately about my \u2018bundle of naughties\u2019, and being selfish is the largest one in it, so I\u2019m going to try hard to cure it, if I can. Beth isn\u2019t selfish, and that\u2019s the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn\u2019t feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don\u2019t deserve to have them, but I\u2019d like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I\u2019m going to try and be like Beth all I can. I\u2019m apt to forget my resolutions,", "but if I had something always about me to remind me, I guess I should do better. May we try this way?\u201d", "\u201cYes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your ring, dear, and do your best. I think you will prosper, for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go back to Beth. Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you home again.\u201d", "That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the traveler\u2019s safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth\u2019s room, and finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.", "\u201cWhat is it, deary?\u201d asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a face which invited confidence.", "\u201cI want to tell you something, Mother.\u201d \u201cAbout Meg?\u201d", "\u201cHow quickly you guessed! Yes, it\u2019s about her, and though it\u2019s a little thing, it fidgets me.\u201d \u201cBeth is asleep. Speak low, and tell me all about it. That Moffat hasn\u2019t been here, I hope?\u201d", "asked Mrs. March rather sharply.", "\u201cNo. I should have shut the door in his face if he had,\u201d said Jo, settling herself on the floor at her mother\u2019s feet. \u201cLast summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences\u2019 and only one was returned. We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn\u2019t dare say so, she was so young and he so poor. Now, isn\u2019t it a dreadful state of things?\u201d", "\u201cDo you think Meg cares for him?\u201d asked Mrs. March, with an anxious look.", "\u201cMercy me! I don\u2019t know anything about love and such nonsense!\u201d cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. \u201cIn novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin, and acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort. She eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him to do it, but he doesn\u2019t mind me as he ought.\u201d", "\u201cThen you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d cried Jo, staring.", "\u201cMr. Brooke. I call him \u2018John\u2019 now. We fell into the way of doing so at the hospital, and he likes it.\u201d", "\u201cOh, dear! I know you\u2019ll take his part. He\u2019s been good to Father, and you won\u2019t send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to. Mean thing! To go petting Papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into liking him.\u201d And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.", "\u201cMy dear, don\u2019t get angry about it, and I will tell you how it happened. John went with me at Mr. Laurence\u2019s request, and was so devoted to poor Father that we couldn\u2019t help getting fond of him. He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent to Meg\u2019s engaging herself so young.\u201d", "\u201cOf course not. It would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing. I felt it, and now it\u2019s worse than I imagined. I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family.\u201d", "This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely, \u201cJo, I confide in you and don\u2019t wish you to say anything to Meg yet. When John comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her feelings toward him.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019ll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will be all up with her. She\u2019s got such a soft heart, it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her. She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn\u2019t think John an ugly name, and she\u2019ll go and fall in love, and there\u2019s an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all! They\u2019ll go lovering around the house, and we shall have to dodge. Meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more. Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off, and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and everything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! Why weren\u2019t we all boys, then there wouldn\u2019t be any bother.\u201d", "Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked up with an air of relief.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t like it, Mother? I\u2019m glad of it. Let\u2019s send him about his business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as we always have been.\u201d", "\u201cI did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as long as I can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for her. Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John love one another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She is conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly. My pretty, tender hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her.\u201d", "\u201cHadn\u2019t you rather have her marry a rich man?\u201d asked Jo, as her mother\u2019s voice faltered a little over the last words.", "\u201cMoney is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should like to know that John was firmly established in some good business, which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable. I\u2019m not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune, but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the possession of a good man\u2019s heart, and that is better than a fortune.\u201d", "\u201cI understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I\u2019m disappointed about Meg, for I\u2019d planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of luxury all her days. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice?\u201d asked Jo, looking up with a brighter face.", "\u201cHe is younger than she, you know,\u201d began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in...", "\u201cOnly a little, he\u2019s old for his age, and tall, and can be quite grown-up in his manners if he likes. Then he\u2019s rich and generous and good, and loves us all, and I say it\u2019s a pity my plan is spoiled.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on. Don\u2019t make plans, Jo, but let time and their own", "hearts mate your friends. We can\u2019t meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get \u2018romantic rubbish\u2019 as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.\u201d", "\u201cWell, I won\u2019t, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten it out. I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens cats, more\u2019s the pity!\u201d", "\u201cWhat\u2019s that about flatirons and cats?\u201d asked Meg, as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand.", "\u201cOnly one of my stupid speeches. I\u2019m going to bed. Come, Peggy,\u201d said Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.", "\u201cQuite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love to John,\u201d said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter and gave it back.", "\u201cDo you call him \u2018John\u2019?\u201d asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes looking down into her mother\u2019s.", "\u201cYes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,\u201d replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad of that, he is so lonely. Good night, Mother, dear. It is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,\u201d was Meg\u2019s answer.", "The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, \u201cShe does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.\u201d", "Jo\u2019s face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her, and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask. She was rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother. This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long confinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.", "She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he knew, then that he didn\u2019t care; and at last, by dint of perseverance, he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor\u2019s confidence, he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.", "Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her father\u2019s return, but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike herself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face. To her mother\u2019s inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and Jo\u2019s she silenced by begging to be let alone.", "\u201cShe feels it in the air\u2014love, I mean\u2014and she\u2019s going very fast. She\u2019s got most of the symptoms\u2014is twittery and cross, doesn\u2019t eat, lies awake, and mopes in corners. I caught her singing that song he gave her, and once she said \u2018John\u2019, as you do, and then turned as red as a poppy. Whatever shall we do?\u201d said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however violent.", "\u201cNothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father\u2019s coming will settle everything,\u201d replied her mother.", "\u201cHere\u2019s a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals mine,\u201d said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little post office.", "Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.", "\u201cMy child, what is it?\u201d cried her mother, running to her, while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.", "\u201cIt\u2019s all a mistake, he didn\u2019t send it. Oh, Jo, how could you do it?\u201d and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite broken.", "\u201cMe! I\u2019ve done nothing! What\u2019s she talking about?\u201d cried Jo, bewildered.", "Meg\u2019s mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, \u201cYou wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?\u201d", "Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note, which was written in a peculiar hand.", "\u201cMy Dearest Margaret,", "\u201cI can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I return. I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr. Laurence will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me happy. I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to,", "\u201cYour devoted John.\u201d", "\u201cOh, the little villain! That\u2019s the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to Mother. I\u2019ll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon,\u201d cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice. But her mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore...", "\u201cStop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.\u201d", "\u201cOn my word, Mother, I haven\u2019t! I never saw that note before, and don\u2019t know anything about it, as true as I live!\u201d said Jo, so earnestly that they believed her. \u201cIf I had taken part in it I\u2019d have done it better than this, and have written a sensible note. I should think you\u2019d have known Mr. Brooke wouldn\u2019t write such stuff as that,\u201d she added, scornfully tossing down the paper.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like his writing,\u201d faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in her hand. \u201cOh, Meg, you didn\u2019t answer it?\u201d cried Mrs. March quickly.", "\u201cYes, I did!\u201d and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.", "\u201cHere\u2019s a scrape! Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured. I can\u2019t rest till I get hold of him.\u201d And Jo made for the door again.", "\u201cHush! Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret, tell me the whole story,\u201d commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.", "\u201cI received the first letter from Laurie, who didn\u2019t look as if he knew anything about it,\u201d began Meg, without looking up. \u201cI was worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn\u2019t mind if I kept my little secret for a few days. I\u2019m so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such things to do. Forgive me, Mother, I\u2019m paid for my silliness now. I never can look him in the face again.\u201d", "\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d asked Mrs. March.", "\u201cI only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn\u2019t wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father. I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more, for a long while.\u201d", "Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands, exclaiming, with a laugh, \u201cYou are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence! Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that?\u201d", "\u201cHe writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo, should take liberties with our names. It\u2019s very kind and respectful, but think how dreadful for me!\u201d", "Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden she stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely, said decidedly, \u201cI don\u2019t believe Brooke ever saw either of these letters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with because I wouldn\u2019t tell him my secret.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t have any secrets, Jo. Tell it to Mother and keep out of trouble, as I should have done,\u201d said Meg warningly.", "\u201cBless you, child! Mother told me.\u201d", "\u201cThat will do, Jo. I\u2019ll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie. I shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at once.\u201d", "Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke\u2019s real feelings. \u201cNow, dear, what are your own? Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the present?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve been so scared and worried, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,\u201d answered Meg petulantly. \u201cIf John doesn\u2019t know anything about this nonsense, don\u2019t tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won\u2019t be deceived and plagued and made a fool of. It\u2019s a shame!\u201d", "Seeing Meg\u2019s usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie\u2019s step was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he wouldn\u2019t come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March\u2019s face, and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once. Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened during that interview the girls never knew.", "When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it wise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, and was much comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.", "\u201cI\u2019ll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan\u2019t drag it out of me, so you\u2019ll forgive me, Meg, and I\u2019ll do anything to show how out-and-out sorry I am,\u201d he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.", "\u201cI\u2019ll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn\u2019t think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie,\u201d replied Meg, trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.", "\u201cIt was altogether abominable, and I don\u2019t deserve to be spoken to for a month, but you will, though, won\u2019t you?\u201d And Laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior.", "Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March\u2019s grave face relaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.", "Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word.", "As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed for Teddy. After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and armed with a book to return, went over to the big house.", "\u201cIs Mr. Laurence in?\u201d asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming downstairs. \u201cYes, Miss, but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s seeable just yet.\u201d", "\u201cWhy not? Is he ill?\u201d", "\u201cLa, no Miss, but he\u2019s had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I dursn\u2019t go nigh him.\u201d", "\u201cWhere is Laurie?\u201d", "\u201cShut up in his room, and he won\u2019t answer, though I\u2019ve been a-tapping. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s to become of the dinner, for it\u2019s ready, and there\u2019s no one to eat it.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll go and see what the matter is. I\u2019m not afraid of either of them.\u201d Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie\u2019s little study.", "\u201cStop that, or I\u2019ll open the door and make you!\u201d called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone.", "Jo immediately knocked again. The door flew open, and in she bounced before Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly, \u201cPlease forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, and can\u2019t go away till I have.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Get up, and don\u2019t be a goose, Jo,\u201d was the cavalier reply to her petition. \u201cThank you, I will. Could I ask what\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t look exactly easy in your mind.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been shaken, and I won\u2019t bear it!\u201d growled Laurie indignantly.", "\u201cWho did it?\u201d demanded Jo.", "\u201cGrandfather. If it had been anyone else I\u2019d have...\u201d And the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.", "\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I often shake you, and you don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Jo soothingly.", "\u201cPooh! You\u2019re a girl, and it\u2019s fun, but I\u2019ll allow no man to shake me!\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now. Why were you treated so?\u201d", "\u201cJust because I wouldn\u2019t say what your mother wanted me for. I\u2019d promised not to tell, and of course I wasn\u2019t going to break my word.\u201d", "\u201cCouldn\u2019t you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?\u201d", "\u201cNo, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I\u2019d have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing Meg in. As I couldn\u2019t, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for fear I should forget myself.\u201d", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice, but he\u2019s sorry, I know, so go down and make up. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d", "\u201cHanged if I do! I\u2019m not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone, just for a bit of a frolic. I was sorry about Meg, and begged pardon like a man, but I won\u2019t do it again, when I wasn\u2019t in the wrong.\u201d", "\u201cHe didn\u2019t know that.\u201d", "\u201cHe ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It\u2019s no use, Jo, he\u2019s got to learn that I\u2019m able to take care of myself, and don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s apron string to hold on by.\u201d", "\u201cWhat pepper pots you are!\u201d sighed Jo. \u201cHow do you mean to settle this affair?\u201d", "\u201cWell, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can\u2019t tell him what the fuss\u2019s about.\u201d", "\u201cBless you! He won\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t go down till he does.\u201d", "\u201cNow, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I\u2019ll explain what I can. You can\u2019t stay here, so what\u2019s the use of being melodramatic?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t intend to stay here long, anyway. I\u2019ll slip off and take a journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he\u2019ll come round fast enough.\u201d", "\u201cI dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t preach. I\u2019ll go to Washington and see Brooke. It\u2019s gay there, and I\u2019ll enjoy myself after the troubles.\u201d", "\u201cWhat fun you\u2019d have! I wish I could run off too,\u201d said Jo, forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.", "\u201cCome on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and I\u2019ll stir up old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke. Let\u2019s do it, Jo. We\u2019ll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once. I\u2019ve got money enough. It will do you good, and no harm, as you go to your father.\u201d", "For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was, it just suited her. She was tired of care and confinement, longed for change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.", "\u201cIf I was a boy, we\u2019d run away together, and have a capital time, but as I\u2019m a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don\u2019t tempt me, Teddy, it\u2019s a crazy plan.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the fun of it,\u201d began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.", "\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d cried Jo, covering her ears. \u201c\u2018Prunes and prisms\u2019 are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of.\u201d", "\u201cI know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had more spirit,\u201d began Laurie insinuatingly.", "\u201cBad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don\u2019t go making me add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?\u201d asked Jo seriously.", "\u201cYes, but you won\u2019t do it,\u201d answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.", "\u201cIf I can manage the young one, I can the old one,\u201d muttered Jo, as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands.", "\u201cCome in!\u201d and Mr. Laurence\u2019s gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as Jo tapped at his door. \u201cIt\u2019s only me, Sir, come to return a book,\u201d she said blandly, as she entered.", "\u201cWant any more?\u201d asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but trying not to show it. \u201cYes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I\u2019ll try the second volume,\u201d returned Jo, hoping to", "propitiate him by accepting a second dose of Boswell\u2019s Johnson, as he had recommended that lively work.", "The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced round on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor.", "\u201cWhat has that boy been about? Don\u2019t try to shield him. I know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. I can\u2019t get a word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.\u201d", "\u201cHe did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word to anyone,\u201d began Jo reluctantly.", "\u201cThat won\u2019t do. He shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls. If he\u2019s done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo. I won\u2019t be kept in the dark.\u201d", "Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and brave it out.", "\u201cIndeed, Sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie has confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don\u2019t keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you interfere. Please don\u2019t. It was partly my fault, but it\u2019s all right now. So let\u2019s forget it, and talk about the Rambler or something pleasant.\u201d", "\u201cHang the Rambler! Come down and give me your word that this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn\u2019t done anything ungrateful or impertinent. If he has, after all your kindness to him, I\u2019ll thrash him with my own hands.\u201d", "The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary. She", "obediently descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.", "\u201cHum... ha... well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and not from obstinacy, I\u2019ll forgive him. He\u2019s a stubborn fellow and hard to manage,\u201d said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief.", "\u201cSo am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king\u2019s horses and all the king\u2019s men couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.", "\u201cYou think I\u2019m not kind to him, hey?\u201d was the sharp answer.", "\u201cOh, dear no, Sir. You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don\u2019t you think you are?\u201d", "Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, \u201cYou\u2019re right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I know how it will end, if we go on so.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, he\u2019ll run away.\u201d Jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made. She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.", "Mr. Laurence\u2019s ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his table. It was Laurie\u2019s father, who had run away in his youth, and married against the imperious old man\u2019s will. Jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.", "\u201cHe won\u2019t do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it sometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often think I should like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India.\u201d", "She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently taking the whole as a joke.", "\u201cYou hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where\u2019s your respect for me, and your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What torments they are, yet we can\u2019t do without them,\u201d he said, pinching her cheeks good-humoredly. \u201cGo and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it\u2019s all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather. I won\u2019t bear it.\u201d", "\u201cHe won\u2019t come, Sir. He feels badly because you didn\u2019t believe him when he said he couldn\u2019t tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very much.\u201d", "Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?\u201d and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.", "\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d write him an apology, Sir. He says he won\u2019t come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it. He likes fun, and this way is better than talking. I\u2019ll carry it up, and teach him his duty.\u201d", "Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying slowly, \u201cYou\u2019re a sly puss, but I don\u2019t mind being managed by you and Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this nonsense.\u201d", "The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on the top of Mr. Laurence\u2019s bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under Laurie\u2019s door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of countenance, \u201cWhat a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?\u201d he added, laughing.", "\u201cNo, he was pretty mild, on the whole.\u201d", "\u201cAh! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, and I felt just ready to go to the deuce,\u201d he began apologetically.", "\u201cDon\u2019t talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my son.\u201d", "\u201cI keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will be an end,\u201d he said dolefully.", "\u201cGo and eat your dinner, you\u2019ll feel better after it. Men always croak when they are hungry,\u201d and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a \u2018label\u2019 on my \u2018sect\u2019,\u201d answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day.", "Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered. She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her sister\u2019s desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, \u2018Mrs. John Brooke\u2019, whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire, feeling that Laurie\u2019s prank had hastened the evil day for her.", "Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time with doll\u2019s sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand. Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for \u2018the dear\u2019, while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.", "As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way. After many skirmishes", "and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.", "Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid Christmas Day. Hannah \u2018felt in her bones\u2019 that it was going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother\u2019s gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.", "God bless you, dear Queen Bess! May nothing you dismay,", "But health and peace and happiness Be yours, this Christmas day.", "Here\u2019s fruit to feed our busy bee, And flowers for her nose.", "Here\u2019s music for her pianee, An afghan for her toes,", "A portrait of Joanna, see, By Raphael No. 2,", "Who laboured with great industry To make it fair and true.", "Accept a ribbon red, I beg, For Madam Purrer\u2019s tail,", "And ice cream made by lovely Peg, A Mont Blanc in a pail.", "Their dearest love my makers laid Within my breast of snow.", "Accept it, and the Alpine maid, From Laurie and from Jo.", "How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them.", "\u201cI\u2019m so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I couldn\u2019t hold one drop more,\u201d said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the \u2018Jungfrau\u2019 had sent her.", "\u201cSo am I,\u201d added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the long-desired Undine and Sintram.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure I am,\u201d echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a pretty frame.", "\u201cOf course I am!\u201d cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it. \u201cHow can I be otherwise?\u201d said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her husband\u2019s letter to Beth\u2019s smiling face, and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her breast.", "Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is. Half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, \u201cHere\u2019s another Christmas present for the March family.\u201d", "Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes, leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and couldn\u2019t. Of course there was a general stampede, and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things were done, and no one said a word.", "Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms. Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet. Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently explained. And Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father\u2019s boots in the most touching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, \u201cHush! Remember Beth.\u201d", "But it was too late. The study door flew open, the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and Beth ran straight into her father\u2019s arms. Never mind what happened just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.", "It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.", "Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you to imagine. Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked, rather abruptly, if he wouldn\u2019t like to have something to eat. Jo saw and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, \u201cI hate estimable young men with brown eyes!\u201d", "There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned, and decorated. So was the plum pudding, which melted in one\u2019s mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said, \u201cFor my mind was that flustered,", "Mum, that it\u2019s a merrycle I didn\u2019t roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin\u2019 of it in a cloth.\u201d", "Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie\u2019s infinite amusement. Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank healths, told stories, sang songs, \u2018reminisced\u2019, as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.", "\u201cJust a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected to have. Do you remember?\u201d asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things.", "\u201cRather a pleasant year on the whole!\u201d said Meg, smiling at the fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s been a pretty hard one,\u201d observed Amy, watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s over, because we\u2019ve got you back,\u201d whispered Beth, who sat on her father\u2019s knee.", "\u201cRather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially the latter part of it. But you have got on bravely, and I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,\u201d said Mr. March, looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him.", "\u201cHow do you know? Did Mother tell you?\u201d asked Jo.", "\u201cNot much. Straws show which way the wind blows, and I\u2019ve made several discoveries today.\u201d \u201cOh, tell us what they are!\u201d cried Meg, who sat beside him.", "\u201cHere is one.\u201d And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm. \u201cI remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this seeming blemishes I read a little history. A burnt offering has been made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters, and I\u2019m sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments. I\u2019m proud to shake this good, industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away.\u201d", "If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it in the hearty pressure of her father\u2019s hand and the approving smile he gave her.", "\u201cWhat about Jo? Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard and been so very, very good to me,\u201d said Beth in her father\u2019s ear.", "He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an unusually mild expression in her face.", "\u201cIn spite of the curly crop, I don\u2019t see the \u2018son Jo\u2019 whom I left a year ago,\u201d said Mr. March. \u201cI see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower. She doesn\u2019t bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me. I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman", "in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don\u2019t know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in all Washington I couldn\u2019t find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me.\u201d", "Jo\u2019s keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father\u2019s praise, feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.", "\u201cNow, Beth,\u201d said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.", "\u201cThere\u2019s so little of her, I\u2019m afraid to say much, for fear she will slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be,\u201d began their father cheerfully. But recollecting how nearly he had lost her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own, \u201cI\u2019ve got you safe, my Beth, and I\u2019ll keep you so, please God.\u201d", "After a minute\u2019s silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair...", "\u201cI observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on every one with patience and good humor. I also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures. I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.\u201d", "\u201cWhat are you thinking of, Beth?\u201d asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her father and told about her ring.", "\u201cI read in Pilgrim\u2019s Progress today how, after many troubles, Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey\u2019s end,\u201d answered Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father\u2019s arms and went to the instrument, \u201cIt\u2019s singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I\u2019ll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the music for Father, because he likes the verses.\u201d", "So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song for her.", "He that is down need fear no fall, He that is low no pride.", "He that is humble ever shall Have God to be his guide.", "I am content with what I have, Little be it, or much.", "And, Lord! Contentment still I crave, Because Thou savest such.", "Fulness to them a burden is, That go on pilgrimage.", "Here little, and hereafter bliss, Is best from age to age!", "Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth\u2019s sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then \u2018to peek at the dear man\u2019, nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke\u2019s umbrella, which had been left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John\u2019s name was mentioned. Amy said, \u201cEveryone seemed waiting for something, and couldn\u2019t settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,\u201d and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn\u2019t run over as usual.", "Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.", "\u201cWhat does the goose mean?\u201d said Meg, laughing and trying to look unconscious.", "\u201cHe\u2019s showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn\u2019t it?\u201d answered Jo scornfully.", "\u201cDon\u2019t say my John, it isn\u2019t proper or true,\u201d but Meg\u2019s voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t plague me, Jo, I\u2019ve told you I don\u2019t care much about him, and there isn\u2019t to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before.\u201d", "\u201cWe can\u2019t, for something has been said, and Laurie\u2019s mischief has spoiled you for me. I see it, and so does Mother. You are not like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don\u2019t mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all settled. I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly,\u201d said Jo pettishly.", "\u201cI can\u2019t say anything till he speaks, and he won\u2019t, because Father said I was too young,\u201d began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point.", "\u201cIf he did speak, you wouldn\u2019t know what to say, but would cry or blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided no.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say, for I\u2019ve planned it all, so I needn\u2019t be taken unawares. There\u2019s no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.\u201d", "Jo couldn\u2019t help smiling at the important air which Meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks.", "\u201cWould you mind telling me what you\u2019d say?\u201d asked Jo more respectfully.", "\u201cNot at all. You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidant, and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own affairs of this sort.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t mean to have any. It\u2019s fun to watch other people philander, but I should feel like a fool doing it myself,\u201d said Jo, looking alarmed at the thought.", "\u201cI think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.\u201d Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.", "\u201cI thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,\u201d said Jo, rudely shortening her sister\u2019s little reverie.", "\u201cOh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, \u2018Thank you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young to enter into any engagement at present, so please say no more, but let us be friends as we were.\u2019\u201d", "\u201cHum, that\u2019s stiff and cool enough! I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll ever say it, and I know he won\u2019t be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the rejected lovers in books, you\u2019ll give in, rather than hurt his feelings.\u201d", "\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. I shall tell him I\u2019ve made up my mind, and shall walk out of the room with dignity.\u201d Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but", "hospitable.", "\u201cGood afternoon. I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your father finds himself today,\u201d said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very well, he\u2019s in the rack. I\u2019ll get him, and tell it you are here.\u201d And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity. But the instant she vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring...", "\u201cMother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I\u2019ll call her.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?\u201d and Mr. Brooke looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said gratefully...", "\u201cHow can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish I could thank you for it.\u201d", "\u201cShall I tell you how?\u201d asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen.", "\u201cOh no, please don\u2019t, I\u2019d rather not,\u201d she said, trying to withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.", "\u201cI won\u2019t trouble you. I only want to know if you care for me a little, Meg. I love you so much, dear,\u201d added Mr. Brooke tenderly.", "This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn\u2019t make it. She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply.", "He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in his most persuasive tone, \u201cWill you try and find", "out? I want to know so much, for I can\u2019t go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m too young,\u201d faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.", "\u201cI\u2019ll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me. Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?\u201d", "\u201cNot if I chose to learn it, but. . .\u201d", "\u201cPlease choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is easier than German,\u201d broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.", "His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. This nettled her. Annie Moffat\u2019s foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, \u201cI don\u2019t choose. Please go away and let me be!\u201d", "Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it rather bewildered him.", "\u201cDo you really mean that?\u201d he asked anxiously, following her as she walked away.", "\u201cYes, I do. I don\u2019t want to be worried about such things. Father says I needn\u2019t, it\u2019s too soon and I\u2019d rather not.\u201d", "\u201cMayn\u2019t I hope you\u2019ll change your mind by-and-by? I\u2019ll wait and say nothing till you have had more time. Don\u2019t play with me, Meg. I didn\u2019t think that of you.\u201d", "\u201cDon\u2019t think of me at all. I\u2019d rather you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Meg, taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover\u2019s patience and her own power.", "He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did. He just stood looking at her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself. What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.", "The old lady couldn\u2019t resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March\u2019s arrival, drove straight out to see him. The family were all busy in the back part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise them. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.", "\u201cBless me, what\u2019s all this?\u201d cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.", "\u201cIt\u2019s Father\u2019s friend. I\u2019m so surprised to see you!\u201d stammered Meg, feeling that she was in for a lecture now.", "\u201cThat\u2019s evident,\u201d returned Aunt March, sitting down. \u201cBut what is Father\u2019s friend saying to make you look like a peony? There\u2019s mischief going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is,\u201d with another rap.", "\u201cWe were only talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,\u201d began Meg, wishing that Mr.", "Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.", "\u201cBrooke? That boy\u2019s tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it. Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father\u2019s letters, and I made her tell me. You haven\u2019t gone and accepted him, child?\u201d cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.", "\u201cHush! He\u2019ll hear. Shan\u2019t I call Mother?\u201d said Meg, much troubled.", "\u201cNot yet. I\u2019ve something to say to you, and I must free my mind at once. Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, not one penny of my money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible girl,\u201d said the old lady impressively.", "Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would probably have declared she couldn\u2019t think of it, but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind that she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit.", "\u201cI shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money to anyone you like,\u201d she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.", "\u201cHighty-tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You\u2019ll be sorry for it by-and-by, when you\u2019ve tried love in a cottage and found it a failure.\u201d", "\u201cIt can\u2019t be a worse one than some people find in big houses,\u201d retorted Meg.", "Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did not know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she could, \u201cNow, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice. I mean it kindly, and don\u2019t want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning. You ought to marry well and help your family. It\u2019s your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you.\u201d", "\u201cFather and Mother don\u2019t think so. They like John though he is poor.\u201d", "\u201cYour parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of babies.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad of it,\u201d cried Meg stoutly.", "Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. \u201cThis Rook is poor and hasn\u2019t got any rich relations, has he?\u201d", "\u201cNo, but he has many warm friends.\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t live on friends, try it and see how cool they\u2019ll grow. He hasn\u2019t any business, has he?\u201d", "\u201cNot yet. Mr. Laurence is going to help him.\u201d", "\u201cThat won\u2019t last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without money, position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better? I thought you had more sense, Meg.\u201d", "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise, he\u2019s got heaps of talent, he\u2019s willing to work and sure to get on, he\u2019s so energetic and brave. Everyone likes and respects him, and I\u2019m proud to think he cares for me, though I\u2019m so poor and young and silly,\u201d said Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.", "\u201cHe knows you have got rich relations, child. That\u2019s the secret of his liking, I suspect.\u201d", "\u201cAunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such meanness, and I won\u2019t listen to you a minute if you talk so,\u201d cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady\u2019s suspicions. \u201cMy John wouldn\u2019t marry for money, any more than I would. We are willing to work and we mean to wait. I\u2019m not afraid of being poor, for I\u2019ve been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him because he loves me, and I...\u201d", "Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn\u2019t made up her mind, that she had told \u2018her John\u2019 to go away, and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.", "Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl\u2019s happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.", "\u201cWell, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a willful child, and you\u2019ve lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m disappointed in you, and haven\u2019t spirits to see your father now. Don\u2019t expect anything from me when you are married. Your Mr. Brooke\u2019s friends must take care of you. I\u2019m done with you forever.\u201d", "And slamming the door in Meg\u2019s face, Aunt March drove off in high dudgeon. She seemed to take all the girl\u2019s courage with her, for when left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry. Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr. Brooke, who said all in one breath, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help hearing, Meg. Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care for me a little bit.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t know how much till she abused you,\u201d began Meg.", "\u201cAnd I needn\u2019t go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?\u201d", "Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced herself forever in Jo\u2019s eyes by meekly whispering, \u201cYes, John,\u201d and hiding her face on Mr. Brooke\u2019s waistcoat.", "Fifteen minutes after Aunt March\u2019s departure, Jo came softly downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to herself, \u201cShe has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is settled. I\u2019ll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.\u201d", "But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away. At the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but \u2018that man\u2019, as Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, \u201cSister Jo, congratulate us!\u201d", "That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a word. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room, \u201cOh, do somebody go down quick! John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it!\u201d", "Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however,", "considered it a most agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them, so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles to the rats.", "Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.", "The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both looking so happy that Jo hadn\u2019t the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy was very much impressed by John\u2019s devotion and Meg\u2019s dignity, Beth beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident Aunt March was right in calling them as \u2018unworldly as a pair of babies\u2019. No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?\u201d said Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she was planning to make.", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t. How much has happened since I said that! It seems a year ago,\u201d answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.", "\u201cThe joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the changes have begun,\u201d said Mrs. March. \u201cIn most families there comes, now and then, a year full of events. This has been such a one, but it ends well, after all.\u201d", "\u201cHope the next will end better,\u201d muttered Jo, who found it very hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way.", "\u201cI hope the third year from this will end better. I mean it shall, if I live to work out my plans,\u201d said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if everything had become possible to him now.", "\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem very long to wait?\u201d asked Amy, who was in a hurry for the wedding.", "\u201cI\u2019ve got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short time to me,\u201d answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before.", "\u201cYou have only to wait, I am to do the work,\u201d said John beginning his labors by picking up Meg\u2019s napkin, with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged, \u201cHere comes Laurie. Now we shall have some sensible conversation.\u201d", "But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for \u2018Mrs. John Brooke\u2019, and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management.", "\u201cI knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it\u2019s done though the sky falls,\u201d said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his congratulations.", "\u201cMuch obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,\u201d answered Mr. Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.", "\u201cI\u2019ll come if I\u2019m at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo\u2019s face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don\u2019t look festive, ma\u2019am, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Laurie, following her into a corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.", "\u201cI don\u2019t approve of the match, but I\u2019ve made up my mind to bear it, and shall not say a word against it,\u201d said Jo solemnly. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how hard it is for me to give up Meg,\u201d she continued with a little quiver in her voice.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t give her up. You only go halves,\u201d said Laurie consolingly.", "\u201cIt can never be the same again. I\u2019ve lost my dearest friend,\u201d sighed Jo.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve got me, anyhow. I\u2019m not good for much, I know, but I\u2019ll stand by you, Jo, all the days of my life. Upon my word I will!\u201d and Laurie meant what he said.", "\u201cI know you will, and I\u2019m ever so much obliged. You are always a great comfort to me, Teddy,\u201d returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.", "\u201cWell, now, don\u2019t be dismal, there\u2019s a good fellow. It\u2019s all right you see. Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately, Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her own little house. We\u2019ll have capital times after she is gone, for I shall be through college before long, and then we\u2019ll go abroad on some nice trip or other. Wouldn\u2019t that console you?\u201d", "\u201cI rather think it would, but there\u2019s no knowing what may happen in three years,\u201d said Jo thoughtfully.", "\u201cThat\u2019s true. Don\u2019t you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then? I do,\u201d returned Laurie.", "\u201cI think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so happy now, I don\u2019t believe they could be much improved.\u201d And Jo\u2019s eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the prospect was a pleasant one.", "Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and Laurie, leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both.", "So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women."]
