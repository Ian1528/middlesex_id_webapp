Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn taught me.", "What?", "Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. My great-granny. She knows a lot about birds. I\u2019ll talk to her then.", "James shook his head. She has no English. None?", "Not a word.", "What about everybody else?", "Some understand but don\u2019t talk, some talk a bit. What about your mother?", "She knows a bit, but doesn\u2019t speak. Why not?", "James shrugged.", "I don\u2019t know. Prefers not to.", "So how can I talk to your great-granny about the birds? You can\u2019t.", "You\u2019ll have to teach me.", "Lloyd dropped the sketchpad beside the rabbits, the grass dried by the morning\u2019s wind. James picked it up and turned the pages until he found the drawings of himself.", "What does it depend on? I\u2019m sorry?", "The picture of me. Why can\u2019t I have it? It\u2019s my drawing.", "But of me.", "It\u2019s my work, James.", "We should at least share it, Mr Lloyd. It doesn\u2019t work like that.", "How does it work?", "Lloyd pointed at the rabbits.", "Don\u2019t you have to skin those? I do.", "You\u2019d better get going. The hide might stick to the skin. I\u2019ve plenty of time yet, Mr Lloyd.", "Well, I have work to do out here, James. I\u2019ll be quiet. I\u2019ll just watch.", "I\u2019d prefer you to leave.", "Lloyd stayed until late afternoon when the rocks and cliff were again in shadow. He walked back to the village, washed and went to the kitchen for his evening meal. Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill slapped a plate of rabbit stew and mashed potatoes onto the table in front of him.", "Thank you, he said.", "James whispered.", "You\u2019re in trouble, Mr Lloyd.", "What have I done?", "You drew me. You said you wouldn\u2019t. Did I?", "He lifted his knife and fork.", "Is this my last supper, James? It could be.", "He ate.", "It\u2019s a very good last supper, James.", "Lloyd raised his voice.", "That\u2019s wonderful rabbit, Mrs O\u2019Neill.", "James translated. Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill jutted her chin at the artist.", "I\u2019m in big trouble, James. You are, Mr Lloyd.", "They laughed.", "So, how do you catch the rabbits? I\u2019ll show you sometime.", "I\u2019d like that.", "But only if you stop talking to yourself. No rabbit is going to come out of a hole with you muttering outside.", "I suppose not.", "And humming too. Do you know you hum? Do I?", "You do. You make a lot of noise for a quiet man. I like to keep myself company.", "There was no dessert, and the tea was cold and syrupy.", "My punishment goes on, James.", "I agree, said Lloyd. It is good with the tea.", "Lloyd stood up.", "Thank you, Mrs O\u2019Neill.", "Lloyd left and returned to his cottage to close the door and resume his work, drawing James with the rabbits, working through the evening at the kitchen table, using pencil, then charcoal, twisting and turning his wrist to prevent smudges, filling sheet after sheet of paper with images of the boy.", "James arrived with breakfast. That\u2019s a lot of me, he said.", "Take a look, James. Tell me what you think.", "James picked through the drawings of his eyes, of his hands, his lips, of the rabbits\u2019 eyes and mouths, of blood congealing, the island boy as hunter, gatherer, me as hunter, gatherer, as island boy.", "It\u2019s all very good, Mr Lloyd. But strange. To see yourself?", "Maybe.", "I\u2019m sure it is.", "Lloyd ate and poured two cups of tea.", "Take some tea, said Lloyd.", "The artist gathered the drawings into a pile and slid them down the table, away from the tea. James sat down.", "How is your grandmother today, James? Still giving out about you.", "Ah.", "She thinks that I\u2019ll get a big head from looking at myself.", "Lloyd stirred the milk into his tea.", "And what do you think?", "I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s different, anyway. Seeing yourself like that. They looked through the window at the sea, sitting side by side, drinking tea.", "What\u2019s today\u2019s plan, Mr Lloyd? I\u2019ll prepare my canvases.", "Will you draw me again?", "Lloyd shook his head.", "Not today.", "Lloyd refilled the cups.", "What will you do, James? Not much.", "You can help me if you want. Doing what?", "Coating my canvases. Priming them.", "James shrugged.", "Grand. There\u2019s nothing else going on. Wonderful. Get the fire going, James.", "James rekindled the ashes and established a flame. Lloyd set the size on the edge of the heat and bent over the fire, a stick in his hand, stirring the gelatinous mixture in a blackened", "pot", "old masters rooms", "like this cold dark", "but dutch", "Most artists don\u2019t do this, said Lloyd. What do the others do?", "Buy them ready to use.", "Lloyd divided the content of the pot and handed a brush to James.", "What should I do? said James. Copy me.", "Lloyd laid two small canvases on the table, dipped his brush into the pot and began to coat one canvas, starting in the left-hand corner and working towards the right. James copied him on the second canvas.", "There\u2019s no colour, said James. Nothing. That\u2019ll come later. When this has dried.", "What\u2019s the point of painting if there\u2019s no colour? That\u2019s what my wife says.", "You should listen to her.", "James brushed as Lloyd had shown him, the boy\u2019s strokes even and rhythmical, his breath softening to near silence, the door open to the sounds of sea and birds, the breeze light enough to freshen the cottage without ruffling the ash in the grate.", "self-portrait: preparing canvas with the island boy", "They coated twelve canvases. James washed the brushes with white spirits, as Lloyd showed him.", "So why do you do it, Mr Lloyd, when you can buy them coated? I like the ritual. Doing it as has been done for hundreds of years. Why?", "So that it\u2019s all my work, I suppose. You didn\u2019t make the canvas, Mr Lloyd. True, but all the painting is mine.", "Not true any more. This painting is mine.", "Lloyd nodded, slowly. That is true, James.", "Are you going to the cliffs today, Mr Lloyd?", "I am.", "Can I go with you?", "No.", "James picked up the emptied porridge bowl.", "Are you finished with the tea? Yes, I have.", "He gathered the cups and pot.", "Thank you, James. You\u2019re grand, Mr Lloyd.", "We\u2019ll do the second coat tomorrow. Then can I paint?", "Maybe.", "Alexander Gore is a full-time member of the Ulster Defence Regiment standing outside his barracks on Belfast\u2019s Malone Road just after eleven on Wednesday morning, June 6th.

Above the line, outside the frame of his picture, he drew the sun as it was in the sky, almost straight above him. He tracked the fall of light onto the cliff face, and traced it onto his page, copying how the sun shaded and lit the outcrops, the caves, the folds and creases in the rock. He trailed the light as it fell directly onto the cliff, as it was filtered and fragmented through passing cloud, each moment of sun and shade different to the one that went before.", "He turned to a fresh page and drew again the outline of the cliff. He switched back to pencil and worked around the base of the rock, digging, hunting to recreate the moment when the island splits open the sea, when grey granite dissects the ocean on its path across the earth, a thunderous roar that catapults water into the air, turning it to foam, to froth, to bead and sparkle in the mid-morning sun.", "A shadow fell over his work. He looked up. At the sky. Hunting for the clouds. But the shadow was from behind. He turned. It was James, again, this time holding a flask and a bundle wrapped in a tea towel. Lloyd threw down his pencil. The lead snapped against a small stone.", "What do you want?", "You forgot something to eat. Did I?", "Yes.", "James set down the food.", "And you went without breakfast. Did I?", "Are you not starving? I\u2019d be starving without my breakfast. Lloyd dropped his sketchpad onto the grass. He turned from the cliff.", "Is that tea?", "It is, Mr Lloyd.", "Some tea would be nice.", "James poured.", "I brought a second cup, Mr Lloyd. Just in case. That was clever of you.", "James poured tea for himself.", "So, are you not starving, Mr Lloyd?", "Some days I can go without.

My granny refused to.", "Lloyd smiled.", "I must be in big trouble. You are.", "James pointed at the tea towel.", "I love brack with my tea, he said. Is that so?", "It is.", "Would you like some, James?", "I wouldn\u2019t mind. If you\u2019re offering.", "They ate and drank.", "I agree, said Lloyd. It is good with tea.", "James picked up the sketchpad.", "That\u2019s powerful work, Mr Lloyd. Thank you, James.", "Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn says the sea is rising.", "Is that the old woman in black? Your great-granny?", "Yes.", "I saw her. A very old woman. That\u2019d be her.", "How does she know that? About the sea.", "She\u2019ll tell you the fairies told her. That they\u2019re worried about drowning.", "Do you believe her?", "James laughed. He shook his head.", "It\u2019s from looking at the rocks. At the differences since she was a child. Has it changed by much?", "Small amounts. But she sees it.", "Lloyd poured more tea and looked down on the sea.", "We should be safe enough up here, James.

Nor am I, Mr Lloyd.", "Masson led the islanders back up the path, singing in French as he went, the girls spinning and skipping behind him, the women giggling and leaning into each other, Mair\u00e9ad among them.

I\u2019m writing a book.", "Lloyd stretched his arms into the air, right, then left.", "I suggest that you and your book are fifty years too late, Mr Masson. Yes, that is what the speakers of English like to believe.", "And what do the French think, Mr Masson?", "That Irish is an ancient and beautiful language worthy of our support.", "Lloyd lifted his cup for more tea.", "The young people want English, Mr Masson. Young people want many things, Mr Lloyd.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill poured tea.", "Languages die, said Lloyd, because the speakers give up on them. That can be a contributing factor, yes.", "Isn\u2019t that then the speakers\u2019 choice? The freedom of their will.", "That choice, that freedom, is often more curtailed and complicated than you might think.", "Is it? I abandon Irish because English is more advantageous to me. I can get a better job, travel further.", "As I said, it is more complicated than you suggest.", "Masson sat back into his chair.", "And what type of art do you do, Mr Lloyd? Landscape. I am here to paint the cliffs.", "Ah, another painter who wants to be Monet. That\u2019s rather rude.", "Isn\u2019t every cliff painter trying to emulate Monet?", "I am not trying to emulate anybody. Least of all Monet.", "Masson took the scone offered by Mair\u00e9ad.", "I imagine Monet is too genteel for you, Mr Lloyd. Too subtle.", "Too boring. Too nice. Too bourgeois. Too bloody French.

My book is different.", "My art is different.", "Miche\u00e1l stood up.", "We should sort you out, JP. Get you settled. Where are you staying? said Lloyd.", "Miche\u00e1l pulled on his cap.", "He\u2019ll be beside you, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd ran his hands along his thighs, flattening the green corduroy of his trousers.", "I paid to be on my own.", "You\u2019re on your own, Mr Lloyd. You have a whole house to yourself. I paid you to be alone here.", "You rented the cottage, Mr Lloyd. Not the island.", "Masson stood up.

What about him, JP?", "An English speaker on the island, Miche\u00e1l.", "English speakers come to the island all the time, JP. Not for three months.", "Everyone is welcome, JP. Whatever language you speak.", "Masson shook his head.", "That\u2019s the problem, Miche\u00e1l, that\u2019s why the language is dying.", "He left. Miche\u00e1l followed, and the room emptied, the tea party at an end. Lloyd stayed on, sipping at his already cold tea, but then left. The women flopped onto the emptied chairs, into their own language.", "That went well, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "They laughed, cursorily.", "They\u2019ll be best friends by the end of the summer, said Francis.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill tugged at the ribbon and opened the chocolates decorated with pink and blue sugars, chocolate flakes and tiny fragments of nut.", "They are very beautiful, she said.

What moment, Mair\u00e9ad?", "The moment when they\u2019re all gone. If I don\u2019t eat them, I save myself from that moment.", "Nothing is straightforward with you, is it? Not even a bloody chocolate.", "She shrugged.", "Some things are, Francis.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill sent the chocolates down the table towards her mother, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.

Just sit back and watch, Mam. Enjoy it.", "They\u2019ll be at each other all summer, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Battle of the ego, said Francis. France versus England.

It\u2019s not that bad, Mam.", "It is. I\u2019ve enough English to know.", "Ah, they\u2019re just being stupid, said Mair\u00e9ad. Well, I don\u2019t like it.", "It\u2019ll be grand, Mam.", "No, Mair\u00e9ad. One is grand. Two is more than we can manage.

Don\u2019t want it.", "It\u2019s just after the quiet of the winter, Mam. You\u2019ll get used to it. No. I won\u2019t. And I don\u2019t like that Englishman drawing James.", "Ah, Mam. Not that again. They\u2019re having a bit of fun together, that\u2019s", "all.", "Francis lifted his cup. Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill poured tea for him.", "Your mother is right, Mair\u00e9ad. He shouldn\u2019t be drawing James. Leave it, Francis. Nothing to do with you.", "I\u2019m his uncle.", "Mair\u00e9ad opened her chocolates, ate one, then a second. And a third.", "We\u2019ll get used to them, Mam, said Mair\u00e9ad. They\u2019ll get used to each other.", "I don\u2019t like it.", "And we need the money, Mam.", "We do, Mair\u00e9ad. Especially when that son of yours refuses to fish.", "Mair\u00e9ad stood up. She scraped the jam back into the jar and gathered the remaining cream in a bowl.", "I\u2019ll use that for butter, she said.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill cut another slice of rhubarb tart for Francis. She added cream from the bowl.", "I wonder how Miche\u00e1l\u2019s getting on, she said. I\u2019d say they\u2019re giving him hell, said Francis.", "Well, he deserves it, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Taking their money and lying to them.", "Ah, now, said Francis. He didn\u2019t lie. He did, Francis.", "More just that he didn\u2019t fully inform.", "They laughed.", "He should have told JP that the Englishman was coming, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "And risk three months\u2019 money? said Francis. He\u2019s not going to do that.", "No, I suppose he\u2019s not.", "But he\u2019ll skip away again tomorrow, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, leaving us with his mess.", "Ah, you\u2019ll do well out of it too, said Francis. Not as well as Miche\u00e1l.", "Nobody does as well as Miche\u00e1l, Mam.", "Mair\u00e9ad gathered the plates and cups, wiped the table with a damp cloth and carried the dishes into the back kitchen. She made fresh tea and sat", "again at the table.

Ah, you love JP, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "I do. And we know him well enough at this stage. Know the routine of what happens when he\u2019s here.", "We do, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. And we enjoy it.", "Mair\u00e9ad passed tea to her mother, to Francis.", "But we don\u2019t know about him and this Englishman, said Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. That\u2019s new for us. Something we don\u2019t know.", "So what do we do, Mam? said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "Let Miche\u00e1l do the running for the minute, said Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn, and then we\u2019ll see.", "They drank tea and waited in near silence until Miche\u00e1l returned.", "Well? said Mair\u00e9ad. What happened?", "The Sasanach wants to move. Says that he wants a more isolated house with better light.", "And what did you say?", "I told him that short of uprooting the house and taking off the roof, there was nothing I could do for him.", "They laughed.", "And JP? said Mair\u00e9ad.", "Fine, until he discovered that he was sharing a turf pile with Lloyd. What\u2019s wrong with that?", "That was the end of him, ranting that he doesn\u2019t want to be anywhere near an English speaker. \u2018I am here for the Irish language,\u2019 he said, \u2018I need full immersion.\u2019", "What did you do?", "I threw him into the sea, Mair\u00e9ad. Full immersion.", "They laughed again. Mair\u00e9ad poured tea for him.", "Seriously, what did you do?", "I had to split the pile in half. One side for JP, the other for the Sasanach.", "Imagine that, said Mair\u00e9ad.

Out, the lot of you.", "Mair\u00e9ad took the scarf from her head, tied her hair into a bun and went into the small backyard to gather turf, hurrying her task as Lloyd and Masson were already outside, on the other side of the wall, throwing clumps of turf into fraying baskets, backs and buttocks against each other, Lloyd working quickly but clumsily, Masson slower and more meticulous in his movements, still bent at the task when Lloyd declared himself finished and picked up his half-filled basket to return to his cottage. He slammed the door, bolted it and shouted through it at the Frenchman.", "Go to hell, he said.", "Masson clicked his tongue.", "Quel mec, he said.", "He continued to fill his basket, gathering for himself the clods scattered about the dividing line drawn into the dust by the heel of Miche\u00e1l\u2019s boot.", "Quel idiot.", "His basket full, he dropped it at the back door of his cottage and walked across the concrete to the lean-to, propped against the toilet house, where he found the sweeping brush that he used every year to clean the yard, the bristles worn, the wood weathered, the top of the handle broken and splintering. As it was, he said. As it always has been. He began to sweep, tidying the yard as he did at the start of every summer, gathering turf scraps, dust and dirt. A dog settling into its basket, he said.

For intruding. Damn you too, Miche\u00e1l. For not letting me know. For taking my money, more money than last year, without telling me that he would be here. An Englishman. In this, my final summer. He shouldn\u2019t be here, not on this island, not in this yard, for this is my place, my retreat, where I sit, alone, at the end of the day, hidden by the whitewashed walls from the rest of the island, from the islanders, the evening sun on my closed eyes as I dissect the day\u2019s language and analyse the phrases and inflections, the intonations and borrowings, hunting for influences of English, for traces of that foreign language creeping onto the island, into the houses, into the mouths and onto the tongues of the islanders, tracking those tiny utterances that signal change, marking the beginning of the end of Irish on the island, these thoughts, this knowledge, encased and protected by the smallness and stillness of this yard, with only the birds to hear my mutterings, as it was in the wood-panelled courtyard of my grandmother\u2019s house on the edge of the village far from the town, further still from the city, sitting on my own at the circular table cast of iron, under the willow tree, the birds above me, around me, witness to my childhood mumblings on those early summer mornings, my parents, my aunts, my cousins still sleeping, my grandmother in the kitchen, humming as she prepared my hot chocolate, a freshness and softness to her movements that would later, as the day aged, become irritated and hardened, but then, in the early morning, as I sat outside, alone in the courtyard, as she stirred the chocolate powder into the warm milk, she was gentle, smiling as she set the blue and white bowl in front of me, smiling still when she returned from the kitchen with a basket of bread, with butter and jam, with a teaspoon, a knife, a napkin and a glass of water, setting them all in front of me, ruffling my hair, telling me how happy she was to see me again, to have me to stay, and I, aware even then of the transience of our intimacy, kissed her hand, her skin not yet old but beginning to grow old, holding her until she pulled away and returned to the kitchen, her slippers slapping the tiled floor still to be warmed by the day\u2019s sun, leaving me alone again with the birds. As it had been here. As I had been here. Alone, in this yard, until now, until", "the arrival of this Englishman with his English talk. Masson lifted the brush and slammed it against the concrete. Damn you, Lloyd. This yard is mine. It will be impossible for me to sit out here, to consider the day in silence because you\u2019ll be there, next door, making noise, and, worse than that, speaking English, an arrogance that I now have to incorporate into my work because your presence influences the outcome, the findings, undermining everything I have done, and I resent that, Lloyd, resent your arrogance, your intrusion, your dominance, your upending of the years that I have spent chronicling the demise of this language, years of cold summers in a damp, mildewed cottage that I scrub and bleach only to watch the blackness return as I sit at the kitchen table picking over slight linguistic shifts in this ancient, dying language, tracking tiny but significant movements from one summer to the next to prove a generational incorporation of English into Irish, a gradual but noticeable shift towards bilingualism, eventually, I imagine, to monolingualism, but gradual, Lloyd, do you hear me? A linguistic evolution that was occurring slowly until you turned up to destroy my work because the shift now to English will be sudden and violent, more in keeping with the linguistic history of Irish towns and their hinterlands than with a remote island. The Irish here was almost pure, Lloyd, tainted only by the schoolchildren learning English, by the intermittent visits of emigrants returning from Boston and London with their sophisticated otherness, and by mercenaries in linguistic mediation, men like Miche\u00e1l who want only to communicate, indifferent to the medium or its need for protection until it one day dawns that the loss of Irish and the rise in English reduces his capacity to earn, to be the man in the middle, the broker, he who can shrug his shoulders and claim misunderstanding when the yard that has always been mine is taken from me without notice or discussion, when an Englishman moves in beside me, without notice or discussion, Miche\u00e1l the Middleman indifferent as he destroys five years of my work, no, more than five, as it took me so long to find this island and to learn their version of Irish, but he is indifferent because he is earning from it, fattening his wallet, improving his lot at my expense, at the expense of my work.", "Masson reached under the overhang of turf with the brush to gather more dust and debris, and collected his sweepings into a pile. He returned to the lean-to to collect a shovel encrusted with cement and heavier than it", "should be.

At the top was a concrete hut, perched and close to the edge and surrounded by sea.", "Quite a view, he said. It is that, said James.", "What\u2019s it like in winter? Don\u2019t know.", "James shoved at the battered red door no longer on its bottom hinge and Lloyd followed him into dull, dingy light.

Absolutely perfect.", "Lloyd sat on the edge.", "This can be your winter hideaway, James.", "James shook his head.", "Only if I come on my hands and knees, Mr Lloyd. You can\u2019t walk here in winter.", "So who warns the ships?", "They\u2019re on their own in winter. Always have been. Not much of a signalling station.", "Not in winter, anyway. Who built it?", "Your lot, said James. They wanted the highest point. Nothing like using local knowledge, is there, James? We should go, Mr Lloyd.

Do this. Do that. Morning. Noon. And night.

I was born here, on this island, eighty-nine years ago. It\u2019s a long time now since my birth, and the world is a different place. Better in some ways, worse in others. My father was a fisherman, out at sea every day but Sunday, while my mother was home on the shore with the other women, skirts hitched to gather food provided by the good Lord, picking whelks and weed from the rocks and sea, sending me as a young child to scramble and reach places she could not.", "He patted her hand, encouraging her onwards, coaxing her to again tell her story, as she had told it to him over the previous three summers.", "The men still fish on the island, but the women and children no longer go down to the shore, no longer forage, and it\u2019s a great pity, causing me great sadness, for there is a lot of nutrition down there, a lot of goodness in the weed and shells to keep illness off the island. But nobody listens to me. An old woman like me. Blathering on. They prefer instead to run down to Miche\u00e1l\u2019s boat for chocolate and cake, handing over money for food already made, food filled with salt and sugar, so far from the health offered up by the island. You should work for your food, JP. Working for your food keeps you strong. That\u2019s my way of thinking, anyway.", "She drew on her pipe and drank tea, and he again patted her hand, smiling, encouraging her onwards, though her words came more slowly than before and her breath was shallower than it had been, a crispy rattle as she inhaled. Fragility. Previously unheard. Not on any other recordings. He stroked her hand. You\u2019re worrying me, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. Unsettling me.

I am, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. Go on.", "There was no boat to bring us things or take things away, leaving us on our own for most of the time, dependent on what God, the sea and the land gave us, which suited me well enough for I was happy that way and I had none of this looking over the shoulder to see what was coming in from beyond, wondering what life was like over there, because my view was limited. I knew nothing else and I had no yearning for something I knew nothing of, though later on others were desperate to go. My own children, all they could do was talk about America, morning and evening,", "frantic for it, though I didn\u2019t bother with it, JP. For as long as there is food and a place to rest I see no point in searching the earth for a place to do the same thing, though I know that in times gone by people in these parts had no choice, it was to leave or to starve, but I was born in a more fortunate time, when that was all over and we could eat well enough, though we wouldn\u2019t get fat, mind you, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much good in that, anyhow. Masson lifted her hand and kissed it, listening for shifts in her language, in her syntax, hunting for markers of change in intonation, inflection, articulation, but found none as she told her story in the same way as last year, and the years before, nothing to undermine my study of the island\u2019s linguistic patterns, this longitudinal analysis of four generations of one family, work that will be upended by this Englishman if you drop your barrier against him, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.

It does me good, not only the freshness but knowing that I am doing what my mother did, what her mother did before her, all the way back for hundreds of years. I enjoy that. That connection with the past. Being part of something older than myself. It makes me feel less alone, JP, less frantic about what time I have left, because I am not leading, only following.", "He poured more tea.", "I have only been across the way three times, once to bury my mother, the second time to bury my father and the third time to bury my husband. It\u2019ll be time soon to cross again. I didn\u2019t have to go across for \u00c1ine\u2019s husband as he was drowned. But you know all that, JP. Three good men lost on an autumn day. My son-in-law, my grandson and my granddaughter\u2019s husband. Gone. Never to come home. Not even for their own funerals. That was a hard time, JP. But as I say, you get hard times", "wherever you are. They have a great way of following people. Though it took a long time for the island to recover. You can imagine. The worst of it was watching Mair\u00e9ad, and she with the baby. He was only months old at the time. Her husband gone. Her father gone. Her brother gone too. That Holy Trinity of men. And nothing to replace them. Only for the baby, JP, she wouldn\u2019t be with us. And that\u2019s the truth of it. But that James is a good lad. Very good to his mother. And to his grandmother. He\u2019s good to me too. And God is good to him. He is good to us all.", "She blessed herself. He drank his tea.", "There aren\u2019t many of us, I know, willing to live like this any more. \u00c1ine, Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, is the only one of my children still on the island. And she now without a husband or a son. My other children are under the sea, little S\u00e9amus who slipped off the rocks, God rest him and have mercy on him, or above the ground and living in Boston. American now. Too soft for this life. You see, there\u2019s a harshness to life here, JP, that not everyone can manage. There\u2019s a harshness everywhere, I know, city or country, but here it is more exposed, stripped bare by the weather and our isolation. That simplicity doesn\u2019t suit a lot of people. They say it bores them, but I have watched. It\u2019s not boredom, JP. It\u2019s fear. The barrenness and rawness frightens them. Sends them away to cloak themselves in timetables, bills, holidays and houses, in sofas, kitchen counters and curtains, a life of buying and owning to mask the bareness of existence. Hide its harshness. Make it more palatable. Tolerable. But I wonder if it does? Maybe, as James is the only young man still with us. The rest have gone, fled, leaving us the wrinkly old men with no teeth.", "He smiled at her. She continued.", "In other places, places with trees and shelter, the baseness of life is easier to disguise, to dress up as something more elaborate than it really is. I see them, you know, even now on this island, running back and forth across the sea, thinking it will be better over there only to find that they miss here. But they can only return triumphant, coming back with something nobody else has \u2013 a new hat, better shoes, a bigger belly, a pair of wellington boots. My own children have returned from America in that way. Trying to prove that they were right to leave. That we were fools to stay. Suitcases stuffed with fancy clothes and tales of where they\u2019ve been, of who they have met, adamant that their toehold on this earth is higher than ours, of greater value. And for what? If it is to secure", "food and warmth, yes, I understand that. But much of it is this hunt for affirmation in a world that affirms little, if anything at all. As though some title could confirm who you are. Some house or car could prove your worth. I suppose that it works for some. Men think it attracts women, I suppose, but what type of man is that? And what type of woman is that, JP? Be thankful to God for what you\u2019ve got, I say, and stop all the time chasing after the next new shiny thing. Sure, that makes us no better than the magpie.", "He checked the recorder, the amount of tape still left on the reel to capture her sounds, but also her thinking, her commitment to the language.

Socrates would enjoy her, too, an old toothless woman huddled in front of a turf fire, though he would bore quickly on the limits she puts on her thinking. Diogenes? He\u2019d admire the simplicity of your life, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn, but despise your adherence to convention while the two Christians, Augustine and Aquinas, would ironically tire quickly of your unquestioning acceptance of God. Nietzsche would obviously abhor your slavish acceptance of the way you live, a life inherited from your mother, from your grandmother, but Schopenhauer would admire you, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.

His mind sought to hold them there, inside his head, to pin them down, to analyse them, process them, categorise them, but they would not still, would not settle in the yard tainted by Englishness, the inside of his head agitated by the molecules of foreign tongue lingering in the air, clinging still to the surface of the wall, to the chair, to the sods of turf, diluting her presence until bit by bit the sounds of her slipped from him and left him with the sounds of the island, the sea against the rocks, the birds calling, the men talking at the village wall, the women working still in the houses, Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and Mair\u00e9ad in the back kitchen talking of the work to do before the day\u2019s end, the floors to clean, the pots to scrub, the grate to empty, the fire to build, the radio on as they worked, the broadcasting men discursive in softer, southern accents, talking of the regularity of the killings, the seeming intractability of violence up there, over there, across the border, Mair\u00e9ad joining in their conversation, talking at them, over them, talking to wonder whether the woman who saw her husband shot would ever recover, whether the children heard the shooting and saw their daddy on the kitchen floor covered in his own blood, dying, Mam, they saw their own father dying and how could they ever get over that and wouldn\u2019t they always be traumatised by the night their daddy died, question after question until Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill turned off the radio because it\u2019s wrong, Mair\u00e9ad, to be immersed in this talk of death on a summer\u2019s evening, a lovely summer\u2019s evening like this one, and she turned the conversation instead to the life of the Englishman, out there on the cliffs, do you think he gets lonely, Mair\u00e9ad?

trilling and chirping, pinning down my attention to distract from the sounds of the kitchen, from the laughter that did not include us, although my father, her husband, was there, laughing with them, my grandmother, my cousins, my aunts, while we waited outside, in the dusk that was almost dark, guests waiting for coffee and dessert, my mother insisting that it was wonderful to be outside listening to birds as she used to during her childhood in the city by the sea with birds more exotic than these, breathing air that was hotter and drier than at my grandmother\u2019s house, much hotter and drier than at our home, an apartment in the northern rain and dark, on the fifth floor, the ocean visible but distant and laced with winds and storms that caused her sometimes to weep, so

now I am weeping because they are allowed to help, Maman, my cousins are helping and I am not, they are allowed to carry cake and whip cream and I am not because Grand- maman told me to stay with you, told me not to move, to stay out here with you in the near dark while they are in there in the brightness, laughing, Maman, having fun, playing games that I cannot play because I am to stay here with you, and she takes my hand to hers, kisses it and whispers to me, you are the family prince, Jean-Pierre, the one who will be king, the one too precious to waste on the drudgery of work, but I like

without you, without Papa, without my cousins, she likes me that way, but not this way, when everybody is here, she is mean to me then, hard, and my mother ruffles my hair, telling me that it is not

intermittently on the arm to ask her to join in, irritated as she again explains that she cannot understand what it is that they are saying so that he once more asks his mother and sisters to speak the French that they learnt at school, the same French that his wife, my mother, has studied at school, at university, the same French that she speaks at home, with him, in the north, but they ignore

dress, how to live, but with him she was free to live as she pleased and she chose to be ungrateful, condescending, to him, to his family, and he, as the Frenchman who had rescued her, found that intolerable, and insisted that she should apologise, beg for his forgiveness, and kneeling in front of me, unbuttoning my shirt, preparing me for bed, tears rolling down her cheeks, she apologises for

Irish supporters of James II left Ireland, ceding control of the country and the language to Protestant England. Most of the remaining Catholic lands were handed over to Protestants and, under the new laws, Catholics could not gain equal access to education or political representation, their rights to inheritance were blocked and they were banned from bearing arms or entering the army and professional classes.", "James returned with a ham sandwich, buttered brack and a cup of tea.", "Thank you.", "What are you writing anyway?

I\u2019m working.", "The Penal Laws had devastating implications for the language as all schools, courts, leases, rent books, writs and summons were only available in English \u2013 this in a country where 80 per cent of the population spoke Irish. Only about one-fifth of the people were bilingual and those speakers tended to work as middlemen, shopkeepers, innkeepers, midwives, servants, pedlars and artisans, all of them providing services to the English-speaking Protestants who were landlords, judges, barristers, attorneys, officers, officials and agents. Those who spoke only Irish were the most impoverished group in society, living in dreadful conditions as tenant farmers dependent on the goodwill of their landlords and the success of the potato crop, their only source of nourishment. In addition, Catholics were obliged to pay tithes to their local Protestant Church of Ireland minister.", "Masson glanced upwards, through the window. Lloyd was walking into the village, unshaven, saturated, his shoulders slumped. Masson watched as the Englishman moved across his window, eyes to the ground. He listened as Lloyd opened the door of his cottage and stepped inside. He returned to his writing.", "Excluded from the centres of power and education, and from the rapid developments in print across continental Europe, the Irish language became marginalised and increasingly an oral language of the poor, relying on poetry and political verse to disperse ideas and ideals. Irish poetry, previously laments on the relationship with nature and landscape, became politicised with many poets yearning for the moment when Ireland would rise again as a Catholic country that cherished its Gaelic culture.", "Monolingual Irish poems gradually became bilingual with poets using Irish and English in the one sentence, or switching language for different verses, creating macaronic works by poets with some fluency in both languages who were writing for an audience in the mid-1700s that had at least some capacity to understand English, a receptive bilingualism such as we see today on this remote island, for example, in Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, who understands what is being said in English but speaks only Irish.", "He watched Lloyd passing his window again, in dry clothes, though unwashed, unshaven, moving towards Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\u2019s kitchen.

How\u2019s he getting on? He\u2019s just back, said Mair\u00e9ad. He spent about a week out there.", "In this rain? said Miche\u00e1l.

I\u2019ll be there.", "Grand so, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd returned to his cottage and slept until James knocked and called him to his evening meal. The rain had stopped.

Masson leaned forward and spoke loudly.", "Caithfidh muid Gaeilge a labhairt.", "He turned to the Englishman.", "I\u2019m sorry, Lloyd, but we have to speak Irish. Leave it, JP, said Miche\u00e1l.", "No, Miche\u00e1l. This is an Irish-speaking house. Is my week away not enough? said Lloyd.", "No, it is not. This is an Irish-speaking island. How much longer should I stay away?", "Don\u2019t let him rile you, Mr Lloyd.", "I\u2019d rather hear him say it, Miche\u00e1l. How long I should stay on the edge of a cliff without proper food and heat. Without running water.", "Until you leave, said Masson. That\u2019s daft, JP, said Miche\u00e1l.", "He shouldn\u2019t be here at all, Miche\u00e1l. This island should be protected from English speakers.", "Miche\u00e1l laughed.", "Like a museum, JP?", "More a conservation project. A zoo then?", "An Irish-speaking island is a precious thing, Miche\u00e1l.", "You can\u2019t lock people onto the island because they speak Irish, JP. You can if it saves the language.", "Nor can you keep other people off because they don\u2019t speak Irish. It\u2019s your island.

You have this last chance to save the language.", "Lloyd leaned forward, towards Masson.", "Are you a linguist?", "I am.", "I thought the job of linguist was to observe, said Lloyd. I am observing.", "You\u2019re not. You\u2019re influencing. Campaigning.", "The language is dying in front of us. Of course I am campaigning to save it.", "But that\u2019s not your job, said Lloyd. That\u2019s not the job of a linguist. It is now.", "Lloyd sighed.", "Do I have to go now? Or may I have dessert first? A cup of tea?", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill set a slice of tart in front of him and poured tea.", "Thank you, Mrs O\u2019Neill.", "He ate and drank.", "So, how long does it have left? said Lloyd. This language.", "If James stays on the island his children will speak Irish and English, as might his grandchildren.", "If he doesn\u2019t?", "If he leaves, his children will probably speak English with a working knowledge of Irish. His grandchildren though will speak only English.", "So it\u2019s hopeless, said Lloyd.", "No, it\u2019s not, but it needs a national commitment to reverse the pattern.", "Miche\u00e1l sighed.", "That\u2019s been tried, JP, he said.", "We need to protect Irish-speaking areas, said Masson, invest in jobs and keep the Irish speakers in the west.", "Nobody stays, JP. Nobody wants to. Make them stay, said Masson.", "How?", "Pay people like James to stay on the island, speaking Irish. What if I don\u2019t want to stay? said James.", "You\u2019re not going anywhere, James, said Francis. I can if I want.", "Francis shook his head.", "You\u2019re the only man in this house. You can\u2019t make me stay, Francis.", "You can\u2019t leave these women out here on their own. I can do what I want, Francis. Go where I want.", "Francis leaned back into his chair.", "No, James. You can\u2019t.", "Mair\u00e9ad stood to gather plates and cups, knives and forks.", "Why does it matter if the language disappears? said Lloyd. If everybody speaks English?", "It\u2019s their language, said Masson. Unique to them. And?", "It carries their history, their thinking, their being.", "Miche\u00e1l pushed his plate and cup towards Mair\u00e9ad. He pulled a cigarette from inside his jacket.", "By God, JP, you\u2019re a fierce romantic. Am I?", "He lit the cigarette.", "It\u2019s a language, JP. A way to talk to each other. To buy bread in a shop. Nothing more.", "James slipped out of the kitchen and waited outside until Lloyd returned to his cottage and went upstairs to bed. He ran then, to the cliffs, to the hut, arriving in near darkness. And why shouldn\u2019t I? I was the one who told him about it, the remains of light still with him as he stepped into a scattering of tins across the floor, of dishes unwashed and a terrible stench of soured milk and stale urine. The bed was unmade, as though the artist had just got out of it, and his clothes were dumped on the floor or rolled into balls and thrown on the shelf. James bent down to pick up a", "pair of trousers, but stopped, it\u2019s not your mess, James Gillan. No, but it is my hut. The easel had the beginning of an oil painting of the cliffs on its stand and a stack of drawings, all in charcoal or pencil, at its feet. James lit the kerosene lamps and opened the door further to freshen the air. He sat on the floor and sifted through the drawings, of the sea and cliffs, shaking his head as he moved from one to the next, they\u2019re too flat, Mr Lloyd, you\u2019re not understanding the light at all, you have it sitting on the top of the sea, but it doesn\u2019t do that, does it? No, it buries underneath, diving between the waves as a bird might, lighting the water from below as well as above. I\u2019ll show you how to do it, Mr Lloyd. If you let me. If you let me use your paints. He rekindled the fire and put water in the kettle to make tea, comfortable that Lloyd was deep in sleep and that nobody else would follow him out to the cliffs at this late hour, most of them never leave the village anyway, too old and dull to come out this way. He sat on the bed, chewing at the desiccated brack, drinking black tea, examining the drawings of birds taped to the wall, gulls, it seems, though their heads are too small for their bodies, a tern\u2019s head on a gull\u2019s body, so more practice needed there too, Mr Lloyd. He finished the tea, the cake and lay down, curling his knees into his chest, careful not to kick at the drawings piled at the end of the bed, watching through the window as the light faded, as night came, a boy Goldilocks, though this is really my hut, and the bed will in time be my bed with its smell that is different to my own, to my mother\u2019s, to my grandmother\u2019s, to my great- grandmother\u2019s. All those mothers that I have to mind. Is this how a man smells? Is this how my father smelt? What my mother smelt when she lay down beside him at night, what I smelt when I lay between them? Francis doesn\u2019t smell like this, no, not this, for this is the smell of oil and paint mixed with sweat and must, of paper, of pencil, of linseed. Not of Francis. He smells of smoke, of sweat, of salt and sea. And of fish. He has a smell of fish that never goes, no matter how newly washed he is, and I hate that smell, that smell of fish, but I like this smell, your smell, Mr Lloyd, the smell of an artist, of an Englishman. Imagine that, Francis Gillan, liking the smell of an Englishman, of Englishness. After all they did to us, James Gillan, you like the smell of an Englishman. Traitor. Turncoat. Off with his head. His legs. His arms. His knees. Bullet to the brain because I like this smell. Because I prefer this smell to the smell of you, Francis Gillan and those bloody fish, and the smell of you panting", "after my mother, chasing her with your stinking eyes, your always leering eyes, why should I like your smell, Francis Gillan, your fishy panting- for-my-mother smell? Can you draw a smell, Mr Lloyd? Paint one? Have you ever tried? Will you paint the smell of me into the painting? And what would that be? The smell of me? The smell of rabbit? Of hen? Maybe I smell of fish already. Maybe I was born smelling of fish. The son and grandson of fishermen who drowned, under the sea to smell eternally of fish. He buried under the covers and rolled from side to side, basting his clothes and skin in the artist\u2019s oils and sweat, in pencil, charcoal and paint, rolling until he was certain that he smelt of something other than fish, because if I smell of something other than fish, of paints and oils, they might all see that I should leave, that I am not a fisherman, not a proper island boy, but something that has to be elsewhere, somewhere other than here looking after my mother, my grandmother, my great-grandmother, and now they\u2019re giving me the mother tongue to look after as well, to save that mother too, to save it all and the other mothers. I don\u2019t want so many mothers.", "He stayed until it was fully night and returned to the village, passing the pen with the heifer that was leaving in the morning.", "Goodbye now.", "He patted her, a gentle hand on her rump.", "Good luck, he said.", "In the morning, before six, Lloyd dressed quickly and gathered fresh pencils and a new sketchpad to take into the cool morning, the sun already risen but shrouded in cloud and lacking the warmth needed to dry the grass that soaked into his trousers as he walked along the path towards the cove, realising as he drew closer that it was empty, with only waves lapping over the rocks and seals sleeping, snoring, on the beach.", "He walked back up the path looking for Miche\u00e1l, but the village was still asleep. He went back down to the cove and began to draw, diffusing the sun even further and turning Miche\u00e1l\u2019s boat into a man-of-war on the cusp of invasion.", "island series: seals as first casualties, after turner", "He again walked up the cliff path, but stopped at the old village, wandering from one derelict house to the next, the roofs gone, the walls crumbled into boulders of stone and fragments of earth. Gables, though, were still standing. He sat down and drew.", "self-portrait: early morning in the ruins self-portrait: in a soup of grey light", "He heard the heifer then, bleating, lowing, and saw her, the animal uncertain of the narrow path, of the seven old men carrying sticks, James in their wake, a stick in his right hand. It was just before seven and the heifer was dark russet, a white stripe down her face, and a rope around her head to serve as a halter. She had rope too reaching under her belly, gathered into a large knot on her spine.", "Lloyd fell in behind James, avoiding the cowpats that became looser and more frequent as they approached the sea. The heifer stopped at the top of the slipway, refusing to go any further. Francis and Miche\u00e1l slipped past, lifted a currach and rowed out to the bigger boat. They climbed on board. Three old men and James stayed with the heifer at the top of the slipway. The four other old men carried two currachs to the water and climbed in, settling the boats just out from the slipway.", "Miche\u00e1l shouted. Lloyd began to draw.", "The men and James slapped the sticks onto the heifer\u2019s rump and she went forward, stepping onto the concrete, liquid manure pouring from beneath her raised tail. They pushed her further down the slipway, towards the water. A plaintive moan rose from her chest. She turned to go back up the slipway, spinning, swivelling, tripping over herself, but they beat her back down the concrete path, the sticks hard against her rump, her flank, her legs. She bellowed and stumbled towards the sea.", "island series: bringing the heifer to market I", "They shoved her closer to the water\u2019s edge. She flipped around, trying to escape, moving left, moving right, seeking a route between the men. island series: bringing the heifer to market II", "But they blocked her and drove her forward, to the waves rolling onto the concrete. She swivelled again, rushing at James and the old men, but the sticks fell on her, a cascade of long, dense wood over her back and sides, pummelling her flesh, the beating relentless until she entered the sea", "fear of water fear of men and sticks heifer\u2019s choice", "Faeces coloured the sea, and the men in the boats reached to take the heifer\u2019s halter, to twist her neck, to keep her nose and mouth out the", "water.

One old man slipped off Miche\u00e1l\u2019s boat and took the three currachs back to shore. The others left with the heifer, her lowing rising intermittently over the noise of the boat\u2019s engine as they left the cove. island series: bringing the heifer to market IV", "The islanders returned to the village, but Lloyd stayed, still drawing, watching as the sea rinsed the slipway, sluicing the concrete, washing her manure into the ocean, dispatching it on its journey across the earth. island series: bringing the heifer to market V", "He closed his sketchpad and walked back up the path.

When?", "Now, if she wants.", "Lloyd led them into the studio, a cup of tea in his hands.", "It\u2019s messy. I\u2019m working. N\u00e1 bac, she said.", "Don\u2019t worry, said James.", "He gathered the drawings from different parts of the room and set them, one after another, on the easel, pausing between each one so that she could absorb his interpretation of her son.", "T\u00e1 siad go h\u00e1lainn, she said.

Over three hundred years.", "Seanbhean \u00f3g, she said.", "A young old woman, said James.", "She shook her head.", "An old young woman, she said.", "Lloyd smiled at her.", "She ran her fingers across the drawing, across the woman\u2019s face and down the fabric of the sheet, eternal life granted unto her, unto me, if I let him, this Englishman who looks nothing like Jesus. She smiled. A permanence, I suppose. Of sorts.", "T\u00e1 go maith, she said. I\u2019ll do it.", "He stared at her.", "Are you sure? he said.", "She shrugged. I said yes.", "You did, I know.

He organised first his drawings, stacking those that he would keep neatly under his bed, and bundling the rest to wait by the fire for burning. He tidied his clothes, cleaned the table, emptied the grate, swept the floor, and set out for the sea, a metal bucket in each hand, one from the kitchen, filled with dirty crockery, the second his toilet bucket, emptied but scattered with traces of faeces and urine. He carried the two along the rocky path and through tufty grass to the cove that he had found with James.

He went back inside and lit a fire, encouraging the flame with discarded drawings and scraps of stick, then bits of turf, cautious of smothering it with a clod that was too big or too damp. He made tea, ate beef and bread and sat in front of the fire to wait on Mair\u00e9ad, to draw gulls with larger heads, to draw the sea with light from underneath as well as above, following the instructions of the island boy who understood light better than the artist, who was taking the key from Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\u2019s kitchen and unlocking the Englishman\u2019s cottage, walking into the studio air thickened by paint and linseed oil, by tiny particles of carbon and charcoal. James inhaled deeply, soaking his lungs in this otherness that I could breathe all day, never come out. I\u2019ll get Granny to leave breakfast, dinner and tea at the door so that I can stay inside, breathing this air, alone, hidden from them and their smell of fish, hidden from them and their plans for the rest of", "my life, in here instead, fingering brushes, paint, charcoal and pencils, opening tubes of paint, of red, of yellow, squeezing the colours onto my fingers and drawing yellow and red stripes across my cheeks, my forehead, initiated, apprenticed, the building of an artist.", "He squeezed paint onto the palette, turquoise blue, France blue, myosotis blue, cadmium orange, lemon yellow, golden yellow, light green madder, deep green madder, scarlet Persian red, deep ruby, cinnabar green, sea green, olive green, deep rich green and white. Lots of white.", "He picked up brushes, thin and thick, and painted a big boat out at sea, its net cast and fish jumping, Miche\u00e1l and Francis on board, smiling. He started a second picture. Another boat. A currach. Closer to shore. Miche\u00e1l and Francis sitting in it, but scowling this time as they rowed Lloyd to the island, three brushes in the artist\u2019s right hand, held up to the sky, an offering to the gods of art. He painted the island as a mountain scattered with cottages, his grandmother and mother at the door of their house, a teapot and plate of scones in their hands, Masson at his cottage door holding his tape recorder, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn further up the mountain, closer to the top, leaning on her stick, smiling beatifically, a yellow glow around her, around her cottage. In the bottom right-hand corner, under the sea, he painted a small boat upside down, and wrote his initials, JG, on the hull. James Gillan. Artist. Not fisherman.", "He made four other paintings, and began to work then with pencils and charcoal, staying until darkness, until he heard his mother outside, talking to JP. He left through the back door and reached the kitchen before she did.", "You missed your tea, she said.", "She set a basket of dirty linen on the table.", "I did.", "He touched the basket.", "That JP keeps you busy. He likes clean clothes. They only get dirty again. Are you hungry, James?", "Starving.", "She took a plate covered by a second plate from the edge of the fire and laid it on the table, in front of her son, whose face and hands were splashed with different coloured paints.", "The plates are hot, James. Thanks.", "What were you up to? Nothing.", "You were a long time at nothing.", "I suppose I was. What were you doing in JP\u2019s? Nothing.", "I heard you talking.", "You must have been nearby then.", "He smiled at her.", "I suppose I was.", "She ruffled his hair.", "You should go to bed, James. I should.", "He left. She washed the plates and cutlery, and stoked the fire. She sat down and lifted the charcoal grey knitting from the basket at the side of the chair. The start of a jumper for James. Dark to hide the dirt. She stretched the knitting across her lap and counted. Eight rows done, two to go, one row plain, one row purl. Ready in time for school, James. If you ever go back. Back to those priests and their ways. She started to knit, sliding one needle over the other and looping the wool. Their quietening of you, James. Their stilling of you. And your nails chewed to the quick. She finished the cuff at the base of the jumper and added six extra stitches to each side. She knitted on, rows of plain and purl to build the foundations of the pattern to come, her own pattern, her design, as she knitted it for Liam, now for James, who tells me nothing, insists only that I shouldn\u2019t worry, that they don\u2019t like me because I\u2019m an island boy, but don\u2019t worry, Mam, because I don\u2019t like them either. She counted the stitches. One hundred and thirty four. As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be. The knitter\u2019s prayer. She continued, three more rows, plain, purl, plain. She stretched the knitting across her thighs, counted the stitches one more time and started on her pattern, blackberry stitch, cable, moss, diamond up the middle and out the other side in reverse, moss, cable, blackberry. She knitted the first blackberry, building three stitches from one, gathering them, wrapping them in purl, and pushing through, the birth of a berry to texture the jumper. She smiled and stroked the woollen knot, a thickening of the wool to keep James warm, as it warmed", "me, knitted by my mother, though not my grandmother who still calls this English knitting, the English scheme, their guilt for the famine, for the land theft. They take our land, she says, starve us and then to alleviate the poverty, to assuage their guilt, they set us up with knitting. Make jumpers this way and sell them, they said. Earn your living that way, they said. Earn your rent that way, they said, though we liked earning our living the other way, from the land that was our land, the sea that was our sea. But they told us to knit, so now we knit. Well, I\u2019m not knitting, says Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. Not that knitting. Their knitting. Their Scottish, English, Irish knitting. I\u2019ll do my own knitting. Knit as my mother did. As my grandmother knitted. Mair\u00e9ad laughed. At Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn sitting up there still, by the fire, with her pipe, her tea and her knitting, defiant, making socks that nobody wants to wear any more, socks with patterns more intricate than these jumpers, socks of waves and weaves, twists and turns, socks that sit in a drawer because my father, her daughter\u2019s husband, was the last islander to wear them, dozens of socks in that drawer waiting for him to come back from the sea. Mair\u00e9ad smiled. At least his feet won\u2019t be cold when he comes back from the sea and opens that drawer of socks. She knitted on, twenty plain stitches, the foundation of the cable that will run up the sides of James\u2019s chest, from his hip bones to his clavicle. Then the moss stitch, plain, purl, plain, purl, the knitting soothing in the stillness of the sleeping house, the sleeping village, her metal needles sliding one over the other to build the base of the diamond pattern that would run up the centre of the jumper, along James\u2019s chest, still skinny, though his voice has broken, and he has shaved once or twice, his chin only, surreptitiously, the hairs washed away, the blade hidden, his father\u2019s blade without his father\u2019s guidance, without the guidance of a man, for the priests are of no use to him, those men in frocks, and he has no time for Miche\u00e1l, even less for Francis, his own uncle, though he likes the Englishman well enough. Maybe he talks to the Englishman as he would have talked to his father, a man of little use to him now, under the sea, in one of these jumpers, dark like this one, a bed now for fish, a blanket for crabs, the wool more enduring than his skin and flesh, than his black, black hair. But what of your bones, Liam? The marrow of your bones? Of you? What is left of them? Of you, my love, down there, underneath in the sea grave, the grave sea. Is anything left, or are you all gone? Eaten? Atomised? Diluted and dispersed.", "Carried from one ocean to the next. Tiny particles of you travelling around the earth. My husband in Australia, in Africa, in South America, travelling the world without me, though he promised that we would go together, leave together, the three of us. But you left without me, Liam. Without us.", "She sipped at her tea and knitted on.", "How long does a bone last, anyway? A skull? Shorter or longer than a jumper? My brother was wearing a jumper, too. Dark as well, like this one, but made by his mother, my mother, with fewer blackberries so that we could tell them apart in the washing. Though they seldom need washing, these jumpers, as they absorb the smells as well as the sheep. Have you ever met a smelly sheep, Liam? Cows, yes. Goats? Terrible smell out of those billies. But the sheep? Left to its own devices, it\u2019s a clean animal. Unlike that Frenchman who is clean only because I clean him.", "She reached the other side of the diamond and began the pattern in reverse, moss, cable, blackberry.", "My father though, he never wore a jumper, not even in the middle of winter. He wore Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn\u2019s socks and shirts, and the sleeveless jacket and scratchy trousers made by the tailor man who came to the island twice a year. He wore a proper jacket to Mass, but on that day, that autumn day, that last day, he was in his traditional clothes, adamant that he felt no cold, though he must have as the water seeped into him, soaking his skin, his lungs, soaking into their skin, their lungs, my father, my husband, my brother. That Holy Trinity of men. Amen. No men. On a still autumn day. Weighed down by wool. By the denseness of knitting. By the denseness of my knitting. My beloved man drowning in my knitting, drowning in my English knitting.", "She stretched the beginnings of the jumper across her lap, the foundations laid, the pattern established. She stuck the two needles into the wool, returned them to the basket and stood up, almost silent in her movements out the door and into the Frenchman\u2019s house, into his bed, staying until the dark grey of the summer night began to lighten, when she dressed again and left for the cliffs, for the Englishman who was dragging the mattress, sheets, blankets and pillow from his bed to the tiny space in front of the fire, setting the pillow where he could achieve most light from the fire and the window, waiting on daylight to creep through", "the panes, waiting for her to arrive, uncertain if she would, this woman who would be his sleeping woman. She rattled the door. He opened it, and reached out his hand.", "Thank you for coming, he said.", "She nodded and shook his hand. He stoked the fire, and added more turf. He handed her the book, open on the page of the sleeping woman.", "Like that, he said.", "Yes, she said.", "I\u2019ll go outside, he said.", "She removed her clothes and draped the sheet over her body, exposing her feet and legs, resting her head on her arm, copying the image from the book.", "He came into the hut. Thank you, he said.", "He adjusted her head slightly and sat on the floor, his eyes shifting rapidly from side to side, up and down, scanning, scrutinising, lucid and blue, hooded with overhangs of flesh though he is still a reasonably young man, about forty, older than Francis, younger than Miche\u00e1l, his skin softer and less blemished than the island men, the sea men, his body softer too, more rounded, unused to work, a pet dog rather than a working one.", "She smiled.", "I prefer the working dog myself. She laughed.", "He stopped drawing.", "Sorry, he said, did you say something?", "She laughed and shook her head.", "Please, Mair\u00e9ad, close your eyes. You\u2019re supposed to be asleep. C\u00e9ard a d\u00fairt t\u00fa?", "He closed his eyes.", "Tuigim. Yes. I understand.", "His pencil moved quickly and his eyes dug more deeply, burrowing into me, soaking me in, absorbing me, though not as Liam did, not as JP does, nor Francis, Francis with his panting tongue. No. Differently to them.", "Mair\u00e9ad.", "She opened both eyes.", "Yes?", "He squinted one eye closed. She laughed.", "Asleep, he said.", "Yes.", "Sleeping. Not squinting.", "Her eyes no longer of use, she listened to his pencil moving across the page, the strokes slow, rhythmical, the pencil pulsing softly, soothing her, lulling her away from the village, away from James, from Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, awake by now, simmering at my absence, at my failure to put the kettle on the fire, the dishes on the table, the day in motion, for that is my job, putting the day in motion, holding it there, in that place, in motion, for the whole day, every day, to do just as she does, as she has done all her life, without question, no question that I have heard anyway.", "Sit up, please.", "He took the sheet and wrapped it over her shoulders, body and feet, so that only her face was exposed.", "We\u2019re lucky this morning, he said. Filtered light.", "She nodded, though uncertain of his words. She looked at the light reaching through the small window, diffused by cloud and glass, broken into beams that lit different parts of the floor.", "Move back a little bit, please.", "He pushed through the air with his hands. She moved backwards.", "And turn your head.", "She turned.", "This way.", "She turned again.", "He sat in front of her then, closer than before, his face pitched forward, leaning into hers so that she could feel his breath, smell his smell, lavender, paint and turpentine. She recoiled a little, but he followed, chasing her with his eyes, his pencil, pinning me down, holding me in place as he drew, looking intermittently at the paper, at the lines and curves on the page, then back at me, at my face, my eyes, scraping and scratching, as though trying to enter me through my eyes.", "She smiled.", "I think I prefer the way the Frenchman comes in.", "Be still, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She nodded.", "Stop moving.", "Beidh, she said. I will. Thank you.", "Alan John McMillan is walking around Market Square in Crossmaglen in South Armagh, close to the Irish border on Sunday, July 8th, the second day of his tour of duty as a soldier in Northern Ireland.

He drank some coffee, gazed briefly at the seascape, and picked up his pen.", "The severity of the Penal Laws reduced from 1770, allowing the slow but gradual emergence of a Catholic middle class, though unofficial and often relentless discrimination continued in everyday life, and continues to this day, more than 200 years later, in the north-eastern part of the country still occupied by Britain.", "Using violent, economic and legal controls, the English insisted that the Irish adapt to them, to their rules and regulations, a policy and attitude that impacted hugely on the Irish language, its use and its structure \u2013 a brief example of which now follows, though I will provide more details later in this dissertation.", "The Irish language had no neutral form of respect for addressing strangers or more senior people, such as \u2018vous\u2019 in French or \u2018Sie\u2019 in German. A version of \u2018vous\u2019 began to appear in the 16th century, during the reign of the Anglo-Normans, but disappeared again as Irish became increasingly a domestic and private language with little need of a neutral form. However, England\u2019s need for societal hierarchy, even in language, compelled the Irish speakers to adapt and introduce \u2018sir\u2019 or \u2018sor\u2019 when addressing English-speaking men in positions of power, adding a layer of linguistic and social inequality that did not previously exist.", "By linguistically reinforcing the divisions already created by violence and economics, the English were able to maintain control and reward those who complied with and slotted into the new hierarchical system, a system of colonisation exercised too by other European powers, including the French. The Irish who accepted the changes imposed by the English fared better economically and socially than those who didn\u2019t. By speaking English and anglicising their Irish names, the Catholic people were more likely to get work from English employers who had little", "interest in learning an Irish name. Those who fared better again were the Catholics who spoke English and converted to Protestantism.", "Irish in time became the language of the peasants, of the impoverished, of the uneducated. Thus marginalised, it stood little chance of holding its place as the dominant language or even of being an equal to English. Instead of becoming a bilingual society such as Belgium or Luxembourg, Ireland became diglossic, with Irish as a private language, spoken only at home and in small, mainly rural, communities. English was the public language, the language of commerce and education, the language of social and economic advancement. Parents opted to pay for English lessons for their children and grew dismissive of attempts by Irish-language teachers to preserve the native tongue as English was the gateway to employment, prosperity and emigration, a key need in Ireland after the devastating famine that caused the death of one million Irish people between 1846 and 1848 and led to the emigration of one and a half million more. Irish, as a result, became the lesser language, the language of those who were not advancing socially and economically within the new structure.", "Scholars and politicians fought back. Thomas Davis, a Protestant writer and Young Irelander, in 1843 declared Irish a \u2018national language\u2019, and in 1893 Conradh na Gaeilge, the Gaelic League, was established to create a mass movement of support for the Irish language.", "But the damage to the language was deep. While Irish was still spoken, its status as a major language was lost and people did not flock to support the language as had been hoped, resulting in the gradual but consistent decline in usage.", "The language on this island lives on, for the moment. Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn, the oldest family member of this inter-generational linguistic study, is a monolingual Irish speaker with no knowledge of English whereas her daughter, \u00c1ine U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, and granddaughter, Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Ghioll\u00e1in, are receptive bilinguals in that both understand English \u2013 though to varying degrees \u2013 but only speak through the medium of Irish.

Is that the same as a good eye?", "You don\u2019t have to be taught how to see. You just see. That\u2019s handy.", "It is.", "Because I don\u2019t want to be a fisherman.

Is that all?", "Pretty much, yes.", "The cliffs over and over?", "Lloyd nodded.", "He wants to be Monet, said Masson. Who\u2019s that?", "The world\u2019s most famous painter of cliffs. I suppose he\u2019s French, said Miche\u00e1l.", "Of course, said Masson.", "They laughed and drank.", "And how is the writing, JP?", "Going well, Miche\u00e1l.

That\u2019s one perspective, said Masson.", "I\u2019m a utilitarian, Masson. A pragmatist.", "And?", "Instead of spending money on a dying language, build houses and hospital beds.", "This is an ancient language with an ancient history.", "So was Manx. So was Norse.

It\u2019s more than that, Lloyd.", "You\u2019re right, Masson. It\u2019s about the common good. And?", "If the common good is better served by English, speak English. What is the common good? Who defines that?", "Better houses, better schools, better hospitals. You can have those and speak Irish.", "Can you? It\u2019s not happening here, on this Irish-speaking island. The only thing that is happening here is poverty. And a dearth of opportunity. Masson tipped back his whiskey.", "How can an artist be so indifferent to something so ancient, so beautiful?", "If I get sick, I want a good hospital.", "And that\u2019s it? The only value to language? To get you a good hospital. And to communicate my symptoms.", "Masson threw his hands in the air.", "This attitude will make you sick.", "Mair\u00e9ad poured a fourth time. They drank. This country was colonised, said Lloyd. Is, said Francis.", "Lloyd shrugged.", "Language is a casualty of colonisation, he said. India. Sri Lanka. The French in Algeria.", "There are similarities, said Masson.", "French was imposed on Algeria, on Cameroon. English on Ireland, on Nigeria. To progress you learnt the language of the coloniser.", "And?", "Lloyd shrugged.", "It happened. All over the world. And?", "The damage is done, said Lloyd. Move on. Invest in the living. The language is still alive, said Masson. Here on this island.", "Spoken by a gaggle of old women, said Lloyd.", "Mair\u00e9ad is not old, said Masson. Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill is middle-aged. The language is not as dead as the English may want it to be.", "I don\u2019t want anything, said Lloyd.", "You\u2019ve always hated the language, said Masson. Been threatened by it. Your people treated this language brutally. Savagely. Lloyd crossed his arms, stretched out his legs.", "Yes, of course, I forgot. The French adored the languages of Algeria, nurtured and nourished the languages of the Berber and Arabs.", "You\u2019re being facetious, Lloyd. Am I?", "Yes, you are.", "Why aren\u2019t you in Algeria unpicking the damage caused by French? Why come here giving out to the English for all their awfulness when you have done exactly the same.", "I\u2019m a linguist trying to help. Go help there.", "Masson lifted the bottle, stilling his hand, his thoughts, for you\u2019d like that, Mother, wouldn\u2019t you? Your son in Algeria. Your linguist son working for you, your language, your heritage. You\u2019d adore that.", "He poured into Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\u2019s cup, but slowly, the whiskey trickling from the bottle.", "Instead I\u2019m here, far from you, Mother, on a remote rock studying a language that is not your language. Not the result you wanted, Mother. After all those years. All those battles. As far from you as I can be, from those days when, your hand over mine, we walked the streets of the town that was almost a city, more my home than yours, although you led me, adamant that in the narrow streets off the main roads would be a teacher to teach me the language of your childhood, of your people, the people that you said were my people though I did not know them, had not met them, knew them only from photographs and saw that their smile was yours, all of you together, happy on chairs under trees by the sea. Avant la guerre, you said. You stroked their faces and returned them to their", "place in your handbag. We walked, day after day, rejecting teachers you thought too casual, too focused on conversation, we talk at home, you said, hunting until you found what you were looking for, on a street that was narrower still, up the stairs of a dusty house, past windows overlooking a yard that had once been a garden, the plants uprooted and replaced with a pragmatic swathe of concrete, up and up again we climbed, to the third floor and into a room of twenty desks, battered and stained but arranged into four rows, neat degradation. A man sat at the front of the classroom, in a worn suit at a larger but equally tattered desk. He stood only when we reached him. He invited us to sit, each of us at a desk while he talked about my future learning, about the rightness of choosing him as my teacher because he would expose me to the rigours and demands of Arabic. But the joys too, Madame Masson. The joys. And it\u2019s a brave act, Madame, because most parents, especially mothers, are wimps, cowards who let their children skim the surface of this great language and settle for a colloquial knowledge without proper learning or understanding, leaving these children, these young people as half- knowers, only half immersed in their roots, half immersed in their history, and this half-knowing, this half-immersion, was, he said, often more dangerous than ignorance. The half-knowers who think they know everything, Madame Masson. But they know almost nothing and understand even less. You don\u2019t want your son to be a half-knower, Madame Masson. And you nodded vigorously, Mother.", "Whiskey dribbled down the side of Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\u2019s cup.", "The teacher shook my hand, welcoming me to the twice-weekly classes that would start on Monday and last for two hours. I went on that first Monday to sit with nine others, all boys, all with skin that was darker than mine, more like my mother\u2019s than mine, the teacher roaming amongst us, demanding answers, sometimes with his voice, other times with the back of his hand against my head, so hard that tears welled and sometimes fell while you, Mother, sat outside on a chair in the hall, plastic glass between us, me inside learning an Arabic I would never use, you outside reading a novel in French and drinking tea from the flask you carried, the flask emptied by the time I emerged from class, my eyes and cheeks red. You jutted your chin at me, Mother, ordering me to grow up, to toughen up, to turn into a man, silence between us as we walked home in the winter dark.", "Francis snatched the bottle.", "You\u2019re making an awful mess, JP. He filled the cups.", "Sl\u00e1inte, he said.", "They drank.", "You should get your own house in order first, said Lloyd.", "Masson sighed, loudly.", "An Englishman is struggling with my attempt to save Irish.", "What\u2019s the point? said Lloyd. What are you trying to prove? It\u2019s almost dead, anyway.", "The point is to persuade people in Ireland and Europe that this language is precious and should be protected.", "Why protect a language that most people don\u2019t want to speak?", "For that, Mr Lloyd, I go back to your Elizabethan poet, Edmund Spenser. He wrote that \u2018The speech being Irish, the heart must needs be Irish.\u2019", "Lloyd yawned.", "Such sentimental rubbish.", "It\u2019s more than sentiment, Lloyd.", "Is it? said Lloyd. James and Miche\u00e1l are no less Irish because they speak English.", "Miche\u00e1l turned to the women. Is there any tea, Mair\u00e9ad?", "She stood up and moved to the fire.", "What do you think, Miche\u00e1l? said Masson. Are you less Irish when you speak English?", "I don\u2019t talk politics, Masson. You know that. We\u2019re talking about language, Miche\u00e1l.", "Same thing.", "Mair\u00e9ad took a cardigan from the back of a door.", "N\u00e1 bac leis an tae, she said.", "She left the kitchen and went outside.", "What did she say? said Lloyd.", "She said forget the tea, said Miche\u00e1l.

An eviction, said Francis.", "From my own kitchen.", "The colonisers have taken over your kitchen, said Francis.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill buttoned her cardigan and wrapped the scarf around her head.", "Ah, we can\u2019t really call JP a coloniser, she said. The French are as bad, Mam, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "They didn\u2019t colonise here, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "They walked towards the cliffs, in the opposite direction to the hens pecking at the ground as they returned to roost, a slow meander in the approaching dusk.", "I hope they don\u2019t drink all the whiskey, said Mair\u00e9ad. I\u2019ll bring you another bottle, said Miche\u00e1l. A better one.

Thrown out of my own house.", "It\u2019ll settle down, he said.", "She snorted.", "You\u2019re at it again, Miche\u00e1l. Always talking in the future tense.", "She hurried her step and broke away, walking faster towards the cliffs.", "Each of them is grand on his own, said Mair\u00e9ad. One at a time.

It\u2019s bad enough without you drumming it up.", "The ground sloped upwards, slowing Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. The others caught up and walked alongside her through the grass, dried and spiked by the day\u2019s sun and wind, still to be soaked and softened by the coming dew. They walked towards the cliffs, towards the sea rushing at the rocks, their bodies bent against the wind, though there was little wind, the bend habitual, inherent, even on an evening still enough for the midges to rise from the grass and bite at their hands, their faces, though none of them noticed, the four focused on reaching the cliffs, the elemental air, the pulse of sea against rock.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill inhaled, deeply.", "It does you good out here, she said. It does, said Miche\u00e1l.", "They sat and watched the sun sinking into the sea, a blaze of pinks and reds.", "This is better than Mass, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "That\u2019s a terrible thing to say, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Is it?", "It is, Mair\u00e9ad. Terrible.", "The monstrance is shaped like the sun, Mam. And?", "Men in dresses hold it up in the air as though it was the sun. That\u2019s terrible, Mair\u00e9ad.", "They worship it. We\u2019re supposed to worship it. I do, Mair\u00e9ad.", "But here it is, in front of us, Mam. The sun. Not a priest in sight. You talk nonsense sometimes, Mair\u00e9ad.", "Do I?", "Maybe you\u2019re a sun worshipper, Mair\u00e9ad, said Francis. An old Indian squaw.", "Or a Greek goddess, Francis.", "Francis laughed.", "The Greeks don\u2019t have red hair, Mair\u00e9ad.", "They might, said Mair\u00e9ad. How would you know?", "I\u2019ve seen those Greek postcards. Not a redhead on them anywhere.", "Mair\u00e9ad nodded.", "I\u2019ll give you that, Francis. A momentous moment.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill stretched her legs across the grass.", "When is the priest coming back anyway, Miche\u00e1l? said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "I could do with communion.", "Haven\u2019t heard, \u00c1ine.", "And confession, Mam.

One Our Father. Two Hail Marys.", "They laughed and fell again into silence, watching the sea and listening to the birds, to the usual raucousness of the gulls, but also too to the summer visitors, the throaty call of the corncrake, the squawk of the puffin.", "Would you move back, Miche\u00e1l? Think I\u2019ve gone too soft, \u00c1ine.", "And you, Francis?", "I would, Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. In the right circumstances.

And James is getting stronger.", "Older.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill snapped at her daughter.", "Is this the James who won\u2019t get into a boat? Not much use on an island, is he?", "He does everything else, Mam.", "Except the very thing we need him to do. That\u2019s not fair, Mam.", "We need a man who fishes, Mair\u00e9ad. He\u2019s a good hunter.", "Nobody buys rabbit, Mair\u00e9ad.", "Mair\u00e9ad shrugged.", "I like rabbit, she said.", "We need a man who catches fish, Mair\u00e9ad. Who sells fish. We don\u2019t, Mam. We\u2019re doing fine as we are.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill shook her head, slowly.", "We\u2019re not, Mair\u00e9ad. We\u2019re not doing fine as we are.", "Miche\u00e1l cleared his throat.", "In fairness, he said, you\u2019ve done well by yourselves out here.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill laughed. Harshly.", "So you like to believe, Miche\u00e1l. What does that mean?", "Those women out there on that island are grand with the pittance I give them.", "That\u2019s not fair, \u00c1ine.", "It is fair. You always give me less than you should, Miche\u00e1l. You won\u2019t even give me double for those two back at my kitchen table.", "They\u2019ll be gone soon enough. I want one of them gone now. Which one, \u00c1ine?", "I have no preference.", "Choose one and I\u2019ll tell him to go.", "You choose, Miche\u00e1l. You brought them both.", "You want one of them gone, \u00c1ine, you choose which one. I can help, said Francis.", "Be quiet, Francis, said Mair\u00e9ad. You know I won\u2019t do that.", "I do, \u00c1ine.", "You always get what you want, Miche\u00e1l. So we\u2019ll muddle through, then.", "Only if you give me more money. The same amount for each man. But the Englishman is barely at your house. Barely eats.", "Then I\u2019ll send the Frenchman away.", "Miche\u00e1l laughed. All right, \u00c1ine.", "They turned from the cliffs and walked back, the sky darkening as they reached the village.

James laughed.", "Looks that way all right. Send her my thanks.", "How long more will you be? Longer now.", "How\u2019s it going?", "Well.", "So is mine.", "Lloyd nodded.", "Then you should go back to it, James. Can I stay here today?", "No.", "I can tell you the news of the village. No talk, James. No gossip.", "I can be silent either. Not tell you anything. No, James.", "Do you want me to show you the puffins?", "No. I\u2019m working. No talk. No gossip. No puffins. But you said that you wanted to see a puffin.", "Lloyd threw down his brush.", "Bloody hell, James. Right. Let\u2019s go and see a puffin.

He hunkered down.", "There\u2019s a colony beneath your feet, Mr Lloyd. Moving underneath without your even knowing.", "James stuck his hand into a hole and pulled out a puffin, the bird\u2019s head and beak of cadmium orange spinning in protest, its feet stamping at the air.", "It\u2019s tiny, said Lloyd. Smaller than I had expected. And those claws are sharp.", "Good for digging.", "Lloyd peered into the hole. Is there a chick in there? Maybe. Maybe not.", "James reached further into the hole and retrieved a ball of soft grey feather. He held the mother in one hand, the chick in the other, laughing as the mother lashed at him with her claws and beak, as she buckled and twisted, fighting to reach her chick. The chick was motionless, its eyes fixed on its mother.", "We should put them back, James. Do you want to hold them?", "No. Thank you.", "They\u2019ll spend the winter out at sea. Grey-faced, the fishermen say. They\u2019re pretty grey-faced today, said Lloyd.", "They\u2019re grand.", "They\u2019ve had enough, James.", "He slipped the chick back into the hole and released the mother. She rushed after her baby.", "She\u2019s frantic, said Lloyd.", "She\u2019ll be fine, said James. No harm done. I imagine that the puffin sees it differently. You wanted to see one, Mr Lloyd.", "I did.", "Now you have.", "I have.", "You don\u2019t look happy about it.", "It seems wrong to wrench them out of their home.", "James shrugged.", "It\u2019s what you wanted, Mr Lloyd. I\u2019m going back to work, James.", "James left and Lloyd sank deeper into solitude.", "The IRA parks a pig trailer packed with explosives beside a bus stop in Rosslea, a rural area in Co.

It is not the bus but a Land Rover, the Ulster Defence Regiment on patrol. The Land Rover approaches the bus stop. The IRA detonates its bomb, killing Sylvia Crowe and injuring the three others at the bus stop, as well as four members of the UDR.", "She returned to the hut. Thank you, he said.", "He left, she undressed and draped the sheet as it had been before. She called to him.", "T\u00e1 m\u00e9 r\u00e9idh, Mr Lloyd. I\u2019m ready.", "He adjusted her, adjusted the sheet, and began to draw. She closed her eyes.", "I must tell him, tell James to tell him, that I want to be in a simple frame, white or cream, not gold, nothing fancy, but plain. A plain frame for the island woman. And on white walls, Mr Lloyd. Only white walls. A plain frame and plain walls for the widow woman, for the young widow woman out here, on the edge. The young widow island woman. My name on the mainland. What they call me when I walk those streets, enter those shops, those eyes, those fingers, those mouths, looking at me, pointing at me, talking of me, see her, over there, going into that shop, coming out of that shop, that\u2019s her, the young widow island woman, you know her, know her story, the young widow island woman who lost her husband, her father, her brother in one day, all of them under the sea, one afternoon, that\u2019s her, god help her, god save her, god love her, though god is good for he gave her first a son, a son who looks like his father so that her husband can live on, thanks be to god, thanks be to the lord god, a father living through his son, through him, with him, in him, thanks be to god, his father\u2019s eyes, his father\u2019s hair, his father\u2019s chin, father, son and holy ghost, holy ghost of a man, of a husband, a lover, a friend, not a trace of him anywhere, in rocks, in grasses, in waves, in clouds, in rain, in prayers, in beads, in crosses, nothing, not a sign. I have looked, day and night, night and day, hunted as James hunts those rabbits, but found nothing, so that only snapshots remain, black and white, eyes squinting in the island sun, a smile across him, but nothing more, for the sea took everything, beating him into fragments small enough to send across the earth on a journey of further erosion and rendering, pounding him into still smaller particles, atomised eternity granted unto him, oh lord, but nothing more, nothing for me to hold at night, to look at in the morning, though she lives on, this sleeping woman, three hundred years, more,", "young still, beautiful, not ravaged by sea, by salt, and so alive still that I am certain I can smell her breath, staled only by sleep, her skin unblemished, untouched by age, painted eternity granted unto her, oh lord, though not unto Liam, for there is no smell rising from those photographs, no breath, nothing but my memory of him, his musky skin, his armpits, his groin, a sweet maleness I have not found elsewhere, not in Francis with his dirty, stinking, fishy smell, nor in JP with his shop- bought masculinity, nor in this Englishman who smells of must and oil, of stale sweat, maybe too of lavender, but no smell from him or anywhere on the island of frankincense, myrrh or sandalwood, those funereal smells never dispersed over my man\u2019s body, over his coffin, for there was nothing to bury, nothing to wake, nothing to dress in his wedding suit, to clean, to kiss, to hold. Nothing. No last taste of sea salt and tobacco from his lips, from his tongue. Though she lives on, this sleeping woman, as though the artist had just kissed her, was about to kiss her again, for he knew her well, as well as I knew Liam, as Liam knew me, as we had known each other before and after our wedding, out on the cliffs on summer nights, on the beach, and then in my bed that became our bed, my sleep then as contented as hers over three hundred years before, a sleep that eludes me now as I toss, turn, pace the floor, walk the cliffs, never again to sleep as she sleeps, as I used to sleep, and would like to sleep again, though I never will, though maybe this artist man, this English artist man, will allow me to sleep as she sleeps, draw me as she is so that I too live on, sleep on, eternal life, eternal sleep, granted unto me.", "Open your eyes, Mair\u00e9ad. Please.", "She stared at him, at his pencil moving across the page, his eyes flicking from side to side, his tongue running intermittently across his lips, moistening them, as though preparing to kiss, to taste as that other artist had tasted his sleeping woman, as though he, this Englishman, needs the taste of me to draw me, to know me as she was known, though I have no need of him, no need of the taste of him, need only that he takes me from here, away to live elsewhere, the young widow island woman hanging from a wall in some strange place, a foreign land while I stay, still setting the kettle on the fire, the dishes on the table, the day in motion, breathing in the fragments of my dead man, living with the bits of him that the sea never got. Just as she will be, that poor mother, back in the house where her daughter had lived, swallowing the air in the hope of absorbing some", "of her, something of her, something left behind by the bomb, the bomb that blew her daughter into tiny fragments. Did they not see them at the bus stop? Did they not see them standing there, the old woman with her daughter, the brother and sister of the man they had taken captive? And still they set off the bomb. Pulled the wire. Exploded their bomb hidden beside a bus stop. Who plants a bomb beside a bus stop? You\u2019ll be like me now, old woman. When you go to town, when you walk those streets and enter those shops. Those eyes will look at you. Those mouths will talk of you. Those fingers will point at you. The old mother of the bus- stop daughter. That\u2019s her, god help her, god save her, god love her. And you\u2019ll go home, old woman, as I do, and you\u2019ll stay home, soaking up the fragments of the daughter that they took from you.", "That\u2019s enough for today, he said.", "He stood up.", "You can dress.", "Go maith.", "Sorry?", "Good, she said. It\u2019s good. Tea? he said.", "She nodded.", "Yes, please.", "He turned on the gas and put on the kettle.", "I have no milk, he said.", "She shrugged.", "Gan bainne, mar sin.", "He turned his back to her and she dressed.

JP is prowling. He can wait.", "You look tired. Did you sleep at all? I\u2019ll be fine.", "Did you get the eggs? No.", "Get the eggs.", "When she returned with the basket of eggs, Masson was at the table. He winked at her.", "Maidin mhaith, a Mhair\u00e9ad. Good morning, JP.", "That\u2019s English, Mair\u00e9ad. You don\u2019t speak English.", "She shrugged, and stood beside her mother at the open fire.", "How many eggs?", "Eleven.", "That\u2019ll do. We can do eggs at midday. And for the evening?", "I\u2019ll ask James to get rabbits. You cut the bread. The porridge is ready.", "James joined the three of them at the table.", "You look tired, Mam. Do I?", "You do, Mair\u00e9ad, said Masson. Did you not sleep?", "He smiled at her. She looked at her son.", "I went for an early walk, James. That must be why. Where did you go?", "Out. Towards the cliffs. How is Mr Lloyd?", "She held his gaze.", "I went the other way, James.", "And coming back?", "It was early. He was probably asleep.", "I\u2019ll go out there today, said James. Bring him food. He\u2019ll need milk, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "And more eggs, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "I\u2019d leave him be, S\u00e9amus, said Masson. He\u2019s gone there to be on his own.", "He needs food. And don\u2019t call me S\u00e9amus.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill poured fresh tea.", "Maybe JP is right, said Mair\u00e9ad. We should leave him be. But he\u2019ll be hungry, Mam.", "He\u2019ll come back if he\u2019s hungry, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "James collected pencils, charcoal and a sketchpad from the studio and headed out across the island, the spider webs unbroken, the dew as it had fallen, undisturbed on the grass blades.", "You\u2019re a poor liar, Mam.", "He scanned the surface of the island around him, looking for grass freshly compressed by rabbits\u2019 feet, tracking that movement to a hole where the soil at the entrance had been freshly disturbed. He set his net over the hole, sat beside it and waited for a rabbit to emerge, as one did, shortly after he sat down. He tightened the net around the rabbit, grabbed the rabbit by the legs, lifted it in the air and smashed its head against a rock. He took the rabbit from the bloodied net, dropped it on the grass and drew its startled eyes and pink tongue flopping out the side of its mouth, blood trickling between red-coloured teeth. Death of a rabbit that is fresher than yours, Mr Lloyd. He picked up the rabbit and went on, prowling until he caught and killed a second one. He dropped the two on the ground, paws entangled, and sketched, first with pencil, then with charcoal, over and over to capture that moment of death, sudden in this case, over in seconds, a jolt, but slow for my father as the sea soaked into his jumper, his trousers, filled his boots, too tightly laced to kick off, the fisherman\u2019s boots so heavy that it is pointless learning how to swim because death, once in the water, is inevitable in those boots. Best not to wear those boots. Not to be a fisherman. Better to be an artist, drawing death instead of being death.", "He picked up the rabbits and turned back towards the village. Miche\u00e1l and Francis were in the kitchen, drinking tea with his mother and", "grandmother. He laid the rabbits on the table.", "We may stay the night, said Francis. Stay for the feast. You\u2019ll stay anyway, said James.", "His grandmother poured tea for him. He sat down.", "We\u2019re going fishing after this, James, said Francis. Are you coming with us?", "I\u2019ve caught the rabbits. That\u2019ll do us for today. We\u2019ll give you a cut of the catch.", "He shook his head.", "You need to start making money, James. I\u2019m grand, Francis.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill handed James a slice of bread, already coated in butter but not jam.", "You should go with them, James, she said. I\u2019m grand today, Granny.", "James poured milk into his tea.", "We need you to start earning some money, James, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "He drank the tea. Ate the bread.", "I will, Granny. Just not from fishing.", "His grandmother tightened her lips and nodded, slowly.", "And what had you in mind, James?", "He turned to Miche\u00e1l.", "Are you coming back here after the fishing? We are, James, said Miche\u00e1l.", "And are you staying the night? We are.", "Will you give my grandmother some fish? I will, said Miche\u00e1l.", "And money for looking after the two men? That too, yes.", "James drank the remainder of his tea.", "Thanks, then we\u2019re grand for today.", "Mair\u00e9ad stood up to clear the table. We\u2019re not grand, James, she said. We have food, Mam.", "We do. For today. But not the winter. We\u2019ll worry about the winter in the winter.", "She shook her head.", "You should go with them, James. Learn the fishing.", "He stared at her and slowly returned the cup to the table. He stood up and walked out of the kitchen, towards the studio, his breath shallow, panting as he pushed against the door, shoving it closed so that nobody could follow with a set of heavy boots and knitted jumper. I don\u2019t want one of your jumpers, Mam. Those drowning jumpers. Not for me, Mam. I won\u2019t do it. I won\u2019t be that fisherman. That tradition. That drowning tradition. He opened a fresh sheet of paper and drew in pencil, two rabbits, dead on the grass, three fishermen, dead on the seabed.", "Not for me, Mam, he said.", "The cries of the gulls penetrated the thin glass panes, calling to each other, but less stridently than earlier for their bellies were full, the anxiety of early morning hunger alleviated so that they could rest, frolic, play, their needs sated. As I want it. The rabbits in, the day\u2019s food secure, the hours free now to unfold without obligation. As it is with Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn, up there on the hill. Though it is not like that with you, Miche\u00e1l, is it? For you always want more, to have more, to own more, a bigger fish, a bigger house, a bigger boat, maybe even one day two boats, two houses, like your brother in America, proof to him that you were right to stay, that you too can toss your scraps at men like Francis, at boys like me, and Francis wants them, your scraps, wants them to lure my mother, to woo her with your scraps so that he can build his own scraps inside her, in his brother\u2019s bed. But I want none of them. None of you. I don\u2019t want a bigger boat. Or any size of boat. He began to paint, oranges, pinks, yellows, colours that Lloyd did not use, would not miss. Use all the greys, greens, browns, blues, and he\u2019ll kick me out. He painted the village, drawing on postcards sent by Granny\u2019s sister in America who prefers the blue and white of Greek islands to the green and brown of this one. He nodded. She\u2019s probably right. Maybe I should go there. Live there. Though that place too is riddled with boats. He copied the box shape of the Greek houses but set them on his island and painted them orange, pink and yellow. He painted the earth a lurid green and the sky a silver grey, a mixture of rain, clouds and sun. He worked until he heard his mother calling people to the evening meal, surprised to find Lloyd already at the table.", "I hadn\u2019t expected you back, he said.", "The rabbits told me of the mayhem. It\u2019s that all right, said James.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill set plates in front of the four men. They had most of the meat. James, his mother and grandmother had scraps of meat and sauce.", "I should have got three, said James. Or caught some fish, said Francis.", "They began to eat.", "What has happened over the last few days? said Lloyd. Have I missed anything?", "Life has gone on in its usual way, said Miche\u00e1l.", "A woman was killed standing at a bus stop, said James. She was younger than Mammy.", "We don\u2019t talk politics, James, said Miche\u00e1l.", "It\u2019s not politics, said James. It\u2019s fact. A woman was killed standing at a bus stop. Blown up by a bomb.", "That\u2019s a shocking way to die, said Lloyd. That\u2019s a shocking way to live, said Francis. Standing at a bus stop? said James.", "Lloyd pointed at James\u2019s hands.", "I see you\u2019ve been painting, James.", "He looked at his hands, paint-spattered.", "I have.", "Unusual colours to have chosen. You took all the decent ones.", "Lloyd scanned his own hands.", "I suppose I did.", "Masson tapped on the table.", "B\u2019fhearr liom d\u00e1 labhra\u00edodh sinn Gaeilge, said Masson. What did you say? said Lloyd.", "I\u2019d prefer if we spoke Irish, said Masson.", "Lloyd sighed.", "I came back to converse, he said. To talk to people. I can\u2019t do that through Irish.", "Then learn Irish.", "Masson switched to Irish. Lloyd looked at Mair\u00e9ad, her eyes distant", "withdrawn", "elsewhere amendment current works future works", "He finished eating, bowed in thanks and returned to his cottage, the fire lighting, used cups on the table, paper on the floor, James\u2019s painting still on the easel", "psychedelic greek irish island", "as she wants from me dealer wife", "half-wife", "but never gets never will", "James came in after him.", "Sorry, Mr Lloyd. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be back. I like it, James. It\u2019s original.", "You do?", "My wife would too.", "That\u2019s kind of her.", "She\u2019s not kind.", "What is she then?", "She runs a gallery. Modern art. Doesn\u2019t like my art, though. Why not?", "Too old-fashioned.", "I like your art.", "Thank you. You\u2019re very kind. Unfortunately you are not my wife and you are not running a famous London gallery.", "James laughed.", "Why doesn\u2019t she like it?", "Thinks that it\u2019s all been done before. That photographs do what I do. She has a point.", "Does she?", "You copy what already exists. That\u2019s what she says.", "But you\u2019re very good at it, Mr Lloyd.", "He bowed.", "Thank you, James. You\u2019re very kind.", "He picked up James\u2019s painting and scrutinised it. She\u2019d like this though.", "So you said, Mr Lloyd.", "She\u2019d like the naivety. But the modernity too. Is that a good thing, Mr Lloyd?", "It might be, James. Bring me your other work.", "James laid his paintings and drawings across the floor of the studio. Lloyd studied the work, the boldness of blending the Greek island into the Irish one, the novelty of seeing the studio as the ant did, the freshness of the boy\u2019s work contrasting sharply with his own. He closed his eyes and opened them again.", "So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do, James.", "James stood motionless, waiting.", "We\u2019ll host an exhibition together, in my wife\u2019s gallery.", "James slapped his hands together.", "Brilliant, Mr Lloyd.", "You do six paintings, James. I will.", "Good lad.", "How many will you do, Mr Lloyd? I don\u2019t know yet. Maybe twenty.", "But she doesn\u2019t like your work.", "She can\u2019t refuse me if you are with me. You, the modern, young, naive artist alongside me, the fusty, old but experienced traditionalist.", "You\u2019re not that old, Mr Lloyd. You still have all your teeth.", "Lloyd laughed.", "In the art world, I am. There\u2019s an obsession with youth. With novelty. That\u2019ll be me then, said James.", "Exactly. I\u2019ll ride on your coat-tails, James. So I don\u2019t have to be a fisherman.", "No fishing for you, young man.", "James smiled.", "That\u2019s grand, Mr Lloyd. Though my granny will be a bag of cats about it.", "She will, James.", "I\u2019ll have to get off the island. Leave. Emigrate.", "You will.", "I\u2019ll live in London.", "You\u2019ll be too famous to live there. Teenage girls will mob you on the streets.", "I\u2019ll hide in your house, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd chuckled.", "They\u2019ll still find you, James.", "Lloyd\tpressed\this\thands\ttogether,\ttapping\this\tfingers\tagainst\this forehead.", "We\u2019ll call our exhibition The Islanders.", "But you\u2019re not an islander, Mr Lloyd. I am now.", "Lloyd gathered up some fresh clothes, and his book of Rembrandt drawings.", "I\u2019ll go back out to the cliffs. You keep painting, James. You\u2019ve only just come back.", "Masson has banned me from talking, so I may as well be at the hut.", "He collected more paints and paper, as well as pencils. Most of the charcoal was already used.", "We\u2019ll have to be careful of our supplies, James. Maybe your wife could send some. From her gallery.", "Lloyd shook his head.", "She\u2019s not that sort of wife, James.", "James looked in the drawer.", "I\u2019ll write out a list of what we need, Mr Lloyd, and give it to Miche\u00e1l. You do that, James.", "He left the studio, whistling bilingual", "trilingual nobody\u2019s lingual not yours, masson not mine", "He knocked on the kitchen door and went in. Mair\u00e9ad was in the back kitchen washing a pot.", "May I have some food, for the cliffs?", "\u2019Bhfuil t\u00fa ag gabh\u00e1il siar ar\u00eds? You\u2019re going back? Already? He nodded and she dried her hands.", "C\u00e9n uair? When?", "Now. Will you come again? To the hut. I will.", "She gathered food into a box and handed it to him. She gave him too a bottle of fresh milk.", "My tea, she said.", "He smiled at her.", "Come whenever you want, he said. Even if I\u2019m asleep. The door doesn\u2019t lock.", "I will, she said.", "She went to him again, at dawn, through rain, water dripping on him as she shook him awake.", "You\u2019re saturated, he said.", "He handed her a towel. He dressed while she dried herself.", "I\u2019m not sure that it was worth your while. The light is terrible.", "She pointed at the fire.", "Bigger, she said.", "He worked at the fire while she undressed and stretched across the mattress, the sheet over her. He knelt beside her and showed her a different Rembrandt drawing, of a woman\u2019s naked back and buttocks, her face towards the wall.", "Like this? he said.", "She looked at the drawing. Silent.", "Nobody will know it\u2019s you, he said. She pushed away the sheet and sat up.", "Thank you, Mair\u00e9ad.", "He drew and she looked at his kitchen floor, at the dust, the dirt, the debris of his meals, of his skin, his hair, his nails. She closed her eyes. Not my responsibility. No responsibility, no obligation, only to lie here listening to his pencil across the page, his chest rising and falling, his breath in and out, a slight rasp at the end of his exhalation, as though he might not be healthy in old age, an irrelevance to me drifting with the sound of lead across paper, over and back, light movements, heavy ones, lines, curves and circles, one sheet, then another, the dense morning light unaltered by the passing minutes, though I am, altering, being altered, the young widow island woman evolving into something else, though what that is, I don\u2019t know, what that will be, I don\u2019t know. Maybe he knows.", "The artist man. The Englishman. Maybe he knows what I will become as he draws my hair, my back, my buttocks, my hips, my thighs, my feet, unblemished still by age, as she is, that sleeping woman in artist\u2019s aspic. And that is what I want, Mr Lloyd. To be lifted away, off, to some place else where I will endure and live beyond the transience of the everyday, a permanence that others get through god, the after-life, the promise of heaven, but I have already looked there, at that, and there is nothing, only a void that once seen cannot be unseen. I need a remedy against its harshness, Mr Lloyd. Against its bleakness. An after-life of my own. An after-life greater than atomised particles of dust across the kitchen floor. An after-life from an Englishman with sad eyes and a sad mouth, burdened by a need to draw, to paint, to live in isolation on the edge of a cliff, a hermit monk, his paints and brushes an offering to his art god.", "Turn over, please, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She paused and stared at him, this artist man who will lift me off the island. I will endure only if you are good, Mr Lloyd. If you are as able as the artist who painted the sleeping woman so that I live as she does, unblemished by the icy winds and needling rain that tear at my face every winter until one day my skin will collapse under the strain, break and blemish as the faces of my mother and grandmother have broken and blemished.", "Towards me, he said.", "She turned. To face him. With her eyes, her mouth, breasts, stomach, hips, her pubic hair, her knees and feet.", "Thank you, he said.", "She bowed her head, slightly, and closed her eyes.", "Eyes open, he said.", "She looked at him looking at her, absorbing her through his eyes, through his pencil.

T\u00e1 s\u00e9 go maith, she said. Good.", "He smiled.", "Thank you.", "She shivered.", "Sorry, you must be cold.", "He threw more turf on the fire.

Ah, Mam. Stop.", "At least she got the holiday before her husband died. More than I got.", "Than you got.", "Ah, Mam, that\u2019s terrible. I know it is.", "Are you all right, Mam?", "I don\u2019t suppose we\u2019ll ever get a holiday, Mair\u00e9ad.", "Probably not. But sure what would you do with it anyway, Mam? I\u2019d have a grand time. Away from here.", "Mair\u00e9ad shook her head.", "No, you wouldn\u2019t. You wouldn\u2019t sit still. I could try.", "You\u2019d spend the whole time worrying about the hens.

Nothing at all, JP.", "He leaned back into his chair.", "So what do you think she is doing out there? With the Englishman. No idea, JP.", "Does she go into the hut? From what I can see, JP.

Go on as normal. See what happens. If anything at all.", "I appreciate your advice, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "She drew on her pipe.", "That Englishman has turned the head of the young lad as well, JP. James?", "She nodded, blowing smoke into the room.", "He was here telling me that he\u2019s going to be an artist, that he\u2019s having an exhibition in London.", "That\u2019s ambitious.", "That he\u2019s going to live with Mr Lloyd.", "She shook her head, slowly.", "There\u2019ll be nobody to catch the rabbits when he\u2019s gone, she said. No, said Masson.", "No more rabbit stew, she said.", "He poured more tea.", "And how is the writing, JP? Going well, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "I hope they make you a professor.", "He exhaled, sharply.", "So do I, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "He placed his cup on the hearth, leaned further forward and took her hands, nodding at her, smiling, adamant that his work be worthy of the doctorate, of the professorship, but worthy too of a wider audience, of newspaper articles, of television news, of radio documentaries. He lifted her hands and kissed them, for I will invite French journalists to meet you, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn, the last of the pure Irish speakers, the last woman to live like this, the shawl over your shoulders, the clay pipe, the knitted socks, and I will persuade them to interview you, to listen as you speak this ancient language untouched by modernity, untainted by the invasion of English, the language as it was spoken by your parents, your grandparents, by your great-grandparents, a linguistic lineage that stretches back hundreds, thousands, of years. He dropped her hands, but held them still on his lap. And after they have spoken to you, recorded you, photographed you, filmed you, they will turn to me, the French linguist who found you and captured the last moments of this ancient language, the great French linguist who lived alongside this woman in primitive conditions on the edge of Europe for five years, no electricity, no water, a diet of fish and potatoes, and he should be honoured, dear", "readers, dear listeners, dear viewers, by the President with the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur for services to culture, for his commitment to this dying language, this ancient beauty. He patted her hands. But then the questions will come, as they always do, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. Why the Irish language? Why not the language of the Basque country? Or the Breton language, Professor Masson? Didn\u2019t you grow up in Brittany? What do your parents think? They must be very proud, or would they have preferred if you stayed at home and studied their language. We\u2019ll ask them. And a rush at the staircase, a swirl of recorders, cameras and notebooks hurrying to the fifth floor to find her still at the window overlooking the distant Atlantic, telling the journalists that she is unsure why he has been in Ireland saving the Irish language when he should be in Algeria learning hers, learning Classical Arabic, Literary Arabic, the language that she tried to teach him as a child, week after week of classes with a man who was deeply committed to the language, to Algeria, a man who, week after week, became increasingly aware of my indifference to his passion, aware too that my father was French, a French soldier, a French colonising soldier who had taken my mother from Algeria to France, my skin lighter than his, my name more French, and for that he slapped me, harder than he slapped the other boys as he walked between our desks, an open hand against the back of my head, a stinging flick of his finger against my cheek, staring at me when he lectured over and over on the awful deeds carried out by the French against the Algerians, the mosques turned into cathedrals, the land taken and sold to self-serving Europeans for a pittance, the language debased, the religion prohibited and, worse again, compulsorily renounced to become French. And the famine. Never forget the famine, boys. Especially you, Masson. An extra wallop to the back of my head. You must never forget the famine, Masson. You must always remember how our great country suffered under the hands of the French, the French who turned us into a version of France, pretty little villages, vineyards, clock towers, when we were nomads, shepherds, our own country with proud traditions, our own ancient languages, but none of it was to be tolerated, all of it to be dismissed, stripped away, do you understand that, boys? Understand that you are to continue the great struggle of what it is to be the son of an Algerian.", "I lifted my hand.", "But my father is French, I said.", "He smacked me on the back of my head, harder than usual.

Probably.", "He sat back down. He turned on the recorder. She likes you, JP, the attention you pay her. I enjoy it, Mair\u00e9ad.", "They listened, her voice cracking, fragmenting.", "She\u2019s more fragile than I thought, said Mair\u00e9ad. Older. She is.", "Her language is older too.", "Irish is changing rapidly, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She patted his hand.", "It\u2019s good to have, JP.", "The water bubbled, boiled. He made coffee and stood the pot and two cups on the table.", "Would you like milk, Mair\u00e9ad? I would. And sugar.", "He stirred in the sugar and the milk. He turned on the recorder again. They drank and listened.", "She knows a lot, he said.", "Ah, she talks stuff and nonsense. Story after story. She\u2019s a reliable witness, Mair\u00e9ad.", "That\u2019s true, JP.

What were you doing?", "What\u2019s it to you?", "I\u2019m interested.", "Why?", "He poured more coffee. She added her own sugar, her own milk.", "I\u2019m looking for Liam, JP. Masson lifted his cup.", "Of course you are.", "He drank.", "Well? he said.", "Well what?", "Have you found him?", "She shook her head.", "No, not yet.", "How often do you go out there, Mair\u00e9ad, looking for him?

What about you, JP? said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "I\u2019ll work and then take a walk along the cliffs. You should go to Mr Lloyd, said James.", "I\u2019m not in the mood for confrontation today, S\u00e9amus.", "Mair\u00e9ad poured tea and drank.", "Are you all right, Mair\u00e9ad? You look pale. I\u2019m fine, JP. Just tired.", "Mair\u00e9ad is always tired, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Into bed too late, out of bed too early.", "It must be that, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "What\u2019s the forecast like, Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill?", "Grand today, JP, but to be bad later this week. I imagine Miche\u00e1l and Francis will be here today or tomorrow.", "Mair\u00e9ad gathered the emptied bowls, the used spoons. You\u2019ll need to get Mr Lloyd when Miche\u00e1l shows. Why?", "He wants him. How do you know?", "Mair\u00e9ad lifted the crockery.", "He said it. When?", "She went to the back kitchen, to the sink, the Frenchman returned to his cottage, to his desk, and James went to the studio, to work at the easel. His fifth piece for the exhibition. A portrait of three women, his mother on the right with her knitting, his grandmother in the centre holding the teapot, and his great-grandmother on the left with her pipe. Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann. Women of Ireland. After Rembrandt. The three of them looking out at me like the men of the Drapers\u2019 Guild, red on their skirts, black on their chests, dark shawls over their heads, though my mother\u2019s hair is bare. The three of them staring at me, the only man in the house and he about to leave, skedaddle away to live as he wants, a life that has nothing to do with their lives, nothing to do with catching food, preparing food, eating food, sleeping, waking to do the same again, one day the same as the next, marooned on a grey rock, repeating the cycle, over and over, again and again. Away I go. Away from the young widow island woman, the middle-aged widow island woman, the old widow island woman, three widow island women knitting, drinking tea, smoking her pipe. And waiting. Waiting for their men to crawl out of the sea. For their lives to restart.", "Miche\u00e1l and Francis walked by the studio window carrying boxes, the women behind them. Francis looked in and tapped on the window. He beckoned James. James shook his head. Francis tapped harder. James sighed, dropped his brush and followed them into the kitchen. Francis was holding up two books, one on drawing, the other on European art.", "I suppose these are for you, James.", "James nodded.", "The one on drawing.", "Francis paused, the two books still aloft.", "Just one?", "James took the book about drawing.", "So, who is the other one for?", "Mair\u00e9ad stepped towards him.", "It\u2019s for me, she said.", "He laughed.", "You?", "Yes, Francis. For me. Francis opened the book.", "What do you want with a book like this? Give it to me, Francis.", "You know nothing about this stuff, Mair\u00e9ad. He turned the pages, slowly, one then another.", "It\u2019s got naked women in here, Mair\u00e9ad. Give me the book, Francis.", "Did you know it had naked women in here? It\u2019s art, Francis.", "He mocked her.", "It\u2019s art, Francis.", "He flicked the pages of the book.", "Did you know, Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, that your daughter is bringing pictures of naked women onto the island?", "I didn\u2019t, Francis.", "Francis shook his head.", "That\u2019s not a good way to be going about things, Mair\u00e9ad.", "He closed the book. He handed it to her.", "I hope you\u2019re not sucking up to that English artist.", "She took the book. She put it on the dresser and unpacked the rest of the shopping. She sent James to fetch Lloyd.", "He wants to talk to you about something, Miche\u00e1l.", "The two men sat at the kitchen table, waiting. Drinking tea. Smoking cigarettes. The women peeled potatoes and washed cabbage in the back", "kitchen. James returned with Lloyd. They sat down. Mair\u00e9ad poured fresh tea.", "I need a canvas, Miche\u00e1l, said Lloyd. For painting on?", "Yes.", "How do I get that, Mr Lloyd? There\u2019s a shop in Dublin.", "Miche\u00e1l laughed.", "I\u2019ve never been to Dublin, Mr Lloyd.", "I\u2019m sure they can send it to you. I\u2019ve written down the name of the shop.", "Lloyd slid a piece of paper towards him. I\u2019ll telephone when I get back across. Thank you.", "What type of canvas, Mr Lloyd?", "Large, unframed, for oils. The best they have. What\u2019s large? said Miche\u00e1l.", "Fifty-five inches by a hundred and forty-eight inches.", "Miche\u00e1l set down his cup.", "I\u2019ll never get that, Mr Lloyd.", "I\u2019ll pay you fifty per cent more than the cost in the shop.", "Miche\u00e1l smiled.", "That\u2019s fair, Mr Lloyd. Right then. I\u2019ll do my best.", "And I need wood, said Lloyd. One by two inches. Enough to frame the canvas and hold it in place with six or seven stanchions. And a box of short nails. Light ones.", "That\u2019s not a problem, Mr Lloyd. Thank you.", "Lloyd stood up.", "I need it by next week.", "He left, and Miche\u00e1l buried his head in his hands.", "That damn man.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill laughed.", "Good luck with that now, Miche\u00e1l.", "You understand English better than I thought, Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. It\u2019s good enough to laugh at you.", "You\u2019re enjoying this too much, \u00c1ine U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Where am I supposed to get a canvas that size? It\u2019s huge.", "You may take a bus to Dublin, Miche\u00e1l. Carry it home on your back. I could tell him that I couldn\u2019t find it.", "And lose all that profit? You\u2019re not going to do that, are you, Miche\u00e1l?", "He shook his head.", "No, \u00c1ine. I\u2019m not.", "Francis opened the book on drawing still on the table. He turned the pages, slowly.", "What\u2019s he going to do with the canvas, James? I don\u2019t know, said James.", "You\u2019re with him all the time.", "I\u2019ve no idea what he\u2019s doing, Francis.", "What about you, Mair\u00e9ad? What have you heard?", "She shrugged.", "What would I know, Francis?", "You must see him sometimes. Out there. On your cliff walks. She shook her head.", "I walk the other side.", "He pointed at framed drawings spread over two pages of the book.", "The drawings in here are small, he said. The canvas he wants is huge.", "He closed the book, his right hand resting on it.", "I don\u2019t like his plan, said Francis.", "Maybe he\u2019s doing the cliffs, said Miche\u00e1l. Like he said he would. He\u2019d have to do that from a boat, said James. To get perspective.", "Francis snorted.", "Perspective, me arse.", "James was silent.", "Perspective doesn\u2019t catch you a fish, said Francis. Doesn\u2019t feed your mother and grandmother.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill poured tea for Francis. She placed a slice of bread on his plate. He smiled at her and ate.", "What harm can he do? said Miche\u00e1l. A lot of harm, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "Some paint on a canvas, that\u2019s all it is.", "She shook her head.", "It\u2019s more than that, Miche\u00e1l. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s up to. Ah, \u00c1ine. He\u2019s come here with a paintbrush, not a gun.", "You can do a lot of damage with a paintbrush.", "Miche\u00e1l sighed.", "You\u2019re being daft, \u00c1ine.", "Am I? Look at the paintings in that book Mair\u00e9ad brought into the house.", "Ah Jaysus, \u00c1ine, he\u2019s not up in that hut painting naked women.", "I know that, Miche\u00e1l, but he\u2019ll leave with a huge canvas that will be his view of us. Of the island.", "JP is writing a book about us, said Miche\u00e1l. You don\u2019t mind that. It\u2019s different, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "It is, \u00c1ine. But it\u2019s also the same.", "She shook her head.", "I won\u2019t understand what JP is writing, she said. But I will understand the picture.", "Mair\u00e9ad stood up and went into the back kitchen.", "Maybe he\u2019ll make us famous, said Miche\u00e1l. People will come from around the world to see us.", "I don\u2019t like it, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "Miche\u00e1l shrugged.", "I probably won\u2019t find the canvas anyway, he said.", "Oh, you will, Miche\u00e1l. And you\u2019ll leave us with your mess.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill followed Mair\u00e9ad. James fingered the shopping still on the table.", "I\u2019ll take the orders to JP and Mr Lloyd, he said.", "They both wanted shaving foam and razors, said Miche\u00e1l. JP wanted soap. For Mr Lloyd there\u2019s a box of pencils and charcoal.", "James delivered first to Masson, who was out walking, then to Lloyd who was in his studio, tidying his paint drawer.", "You\u2019re causing a stir, said James. Am I? And why is that?", "Nobody understands why you want so big a canvas. And they have sent you to find out.", "No. I came anyway.", "So you don\u2019t want to know why I want the big canvas.", "James shrugged.", "I never said that.", "It\u2019s for a single work, James. The best piece of work I may ever do. That\u2019s exciting, Mr Lloyd.", "It\u2019s an Irish version of a Gauguin painting. Can I see it?", "No. Not yet.", "I won\u2019t tell anyone.", "I\u2019m not ready to show you. To show anybody. When will you be ready?", "I don\u2019t know.", "James turned to leave.", "Stay. You need to tidy this mess. You\u2019ve turned into a messy worker, James. Lids off tubes, paint drying out, brushes not properly washed.", "I wasn\u2019t expecting you back, Mr Lloyd.", "That may well be, but wash these brushes and sweep the floor. Yes, Mr Lloyd.", "James went to the sink in the back kitchen and rubbed white spirits into the brushes, weaving his fingers through the bristles, breaking down the paint, splashing flecks of white, grey, blue, black and red across the sink. He dried the bristles with a cloth and began sweeping.", "Can I stay in your house in London, Mr Lloyd? We\u2019ll see, James.", "Is it far from your house to the art school? No. Not far.", "I can go to art school and be your assistant.", "Only if you wash your brushes and sweep the floor. Yes, Mr Lloyd.", "And close paint tubes. Yes, Mr Lloyd.", "You used to be tidy, James.", "My art is better when I\u2019m messy, Mr Lloyd. When I forget about being tidy.", "Lloyd nodded.", "A true artist then. That\u2019s right, Mr Lloyd.", "He finished sweeping and retrieved his Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann. He perched it on a chair and knelt in front of the three women.", "Not today, James.", "I have to finish this, Mr Lloyd. I need to work alone today.", "So what should I do?", "Lloyd shrugged.", "Go to the cliffs, James. Practise drawing.", "James stood up, slowly.", "Get some rabbits as well.", "James closed the door and Lloyd taped several sheets of paper together and stretched them across the kitchen table. He locked the doors", "not for him apprentice eyes", "He drew in pencil, Mair\u00e9ad, standing, almost naked, to the right of the centre, reaching for an apple, the other islanders around her, James with two rabbits, Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill with her teapot, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn dressed in black, leaning on her stick, smoking her pipe, Miche\u00e1l with his boat and bag of money, Francis with two fish, Masson in a beret holding his black recorder, all of them stretched across the horizontal plain filled with grasses, sea, cliffs, beaches and rock, filled with animals, tamed and wild, a gull, a hen, a dog, a sheep, a cormorant, a pig, a cat, a fish, a puffin, a cow, and he drew then the island\u2019s ghosts and spirits, the three drowned fishermen, half on land, half in the sea, their boat, nets and dead fish spilling from a bucket, and, in the distance, a darkened priest holding a cross, ethereal.", "island series: where do we come from? what are we? where are we going? after gauguin", "He rolled up the drawing and carried it upstairs to the room where he slept, setting it on the floor on the far side of his bed, away from James who was on the cliff, his eyes tracking the movement of light, left and right, up and down, scanning the surface for change and disparity, as though tracing rabbits, marking the fall of light into clefts and crevices as he marked a rabbit disappearing into the ground beneath him. He drew then, long vertical lines, his eyes and hands working together, a hum rising from his lips as he shaded and lightened, as he drew and redrew, page after page. And then he laughed. I am turning into you, Mr Lloyd. A madman out here on the cliffs, drawing and humming to myself, my hand out here on the edge dancing with my brain, swirling and twisting and", "turning and spinning, mind and fingers working as one, as they never do back there, back there killing rabbits, catching fish, pulling cabbage, planting potatoes, digging turnips, collecting eggs, cleaning sheds, back there listening to Francis, to my granny, to my mother, watching her, watching them, watching them watching me.", "He drew waves pounding the rock, sea hammering the cliff, ocean crashing into the island. He drew water foaming and frothing, water splashing, water surging, page after page, none of it capturing the thunderous roar of the Atlantic Ocean on its passage east from America, south-east from the Arctic Circle. How do you draw noise, Mr Lloyd? How do I paint the clangour of battle between ocean and land, sea and rock? The sounds reverberating against the stone, cracking the air? The raucousness of gulls? Of terns? I draw them open-beaked, but still they are silent.", "He hunched further into himself, and drew cormorants with open mouths, fulmars and terns in huddles of cacophonous chatter, but failed over and over to recreate the energy of their noise. The bursting crackle. As it is with JP\u2019s recordings of Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. I want that, Mr Lloyd. That energy in my painting. Those sounds of ocean and bird oozing from my painting hanging from the white wall of the London gallery. Symphony of Bird and Wave by James Gillan. Yes, I did it all by myself. Yes, at my age. An extraordinary piece of work, young man. Thank you. A prodigious talent. Thank you. The Mozart of the art world. Raw talent. An international discovery. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Lloyd beaming proudly. His arm over my shoulder as we are photographed by the newspapers. The Times, the Guardian. Even the Irish Times sends a reporter to cover the opening, to depict this great Anglo-Irish relationship in art. News reports. Article after article. Despite all the troubles of Northern Ireland and the tensions between Dublin and London, a wonderful new exhibition showing the work of an English artist and his Irish prot\u00e9g\u00e9 proves that art is greater than politics. Art as peacemaker, as bridge builder. A new religion that is neither Catholic nor Protestant. A spiritual experience without the priest.", "He bowed and laughed.", "And not a fish in sight, Francis Gillan.", "He closed the sketchpad and walked to the hut, to tidy, to draw, sheet after sheet of birds, of rabbits, of sea and cliffs, but then grew hungry, too", "hungry to be away any longer. He tracked rabbits as they bounded through the grass, set three traps, crushed three skulls and walked back to the village, the rabbits over his shoulder, the sketchpad filled with drawings under his arm. Triumphant Island Boy by James Gillan.", "He laid the rabbits and sketchpad on the kitchen table.", "Good-looking rabbits, said Mair\u00e9ad. I\u2019ll gut them, he said.", "Are you hungry?", "Starving, Mam.", "I\u2019ll get you something.", "She scrambled eggs on a pan over the fire and cut two slices of soda bread.", "Thank you, he said.", "She sat opposite him and reached for the sketchpad.", "May I look, James?", "Only if you don\u2019t talk about it. I won\u2019t, she said.", "She turned the pages, slowly, stopping at each one to scrutinise her son\u2019s work.", "It\u2019s very good, she said. As good as his, Mam? Different. Both good.", "He laughed.", "You have to say that. You\u2019re my mother. I don\u2019t have to anything, James Gillan.", "She turned the pages. He ate.", "I feel like I\u2019m out there, James. As though I can hear the sea, the birds.", "He smiled at her.", "I worked at that, Mam.", "I can see that. It\u2019s very good. Thank you.", "Your birds are much better than his.", "James nodded.", "His birds are terrible, Mam. They must have none in London. What does he say about it? About your work.", "Hasn\u2019t seen much of it. Not recently. Too obsessed with his own.", "That\u2019s how you artist types are, James. Obsessed.", "She poured tea for them both, the rabbits\u2019 blood pooled and congealed beside them.", "I\u2019m going to go to London with him, Mam. I know.", "Do art there.", "She patted his hand.", "I didn\u2019t think you were going there to fish, James.", "He laughed.", "Will you be all right, Mam? All right if I go?", "She shrugged.", "There\u2019ll be no rabbits, Mam. I know, James.", "She closed her eyes, briefly. Opened them again.", "Your granny will figure something out, James. She always does.", "James used the last of the bread to mop up his eggs.", "I\u2019m doing an exhibition with him, Mam. Six of the paintings will be mine.", "How many have you done?", "Five are ready. Or nearly ready. A bit to do still. I wish you luck, James.", "You can come to visit me. See my work. Maybe.", "She gathered the crockery.", "Will you miss me, Mam?", "I will, James, but we\u2019re used to missing around here. We are, Mam. Experts at it.", "She stood up.", "It\u2019s beds day today.", "I\u2019ll be doing my own soon. In London. You will.", "Less work for you.", "Indeed. I won\u2019t know myself. Lady of leisure.", "She ruffled his hair.", "I\u2019ll have your jumper finished before you go. Thanks, Mam.", "She lifted the crockery, spilling tea down her front.", "That was stupid of me. You\u2019ll be grand, Mam.", "She nodded.", "Will you clean the henhouse after the rabbits? she said. I will.", "He carried the rabbits to the back kitchen when his mother had finished the dishes, taking with him his grandmother\u2019s knife and cleaver. He cut into the belly, releasing a puff of heat, and nicked the innards, detaching the heart, stomach, intestines, kidneys, liver and lungs. He scooped them out with his hand and dumped them into a bowl but picked out the kidneys and liver to set on the draining board. He cut into the fur just below the head and, pressing his knife into the flesh, drew back the pelt with his left hand to expose the white pink body of the rabbit. He severed the head, shins and feet with the cleaver and rinsed the cavity where the stomach had been. He moved on to the next rabbit. And then the third. He threw the heads and feet in the bowl and rinsed the sink.", "His mother stood beside him with the wicker basket of bed linen.", "You\u2019re finished, James? she said. I am.", "She dumped the sheets on the floor.", "The rabbits look good, James. Meaty. They\u2019re well fed, all right.", "He cleaved the three rabbits into twelve pieces.", "Perfect, she said. I\u2019ll get them on now.", "He picked up the bowl of innards.", "I\u2019ll give this to the pig, he said. And do the henhouse. Thank you, James.", "She put the kidneys and livers on a plate and cleaned the sink, washing off the traces of blood and flesh left by her son. She carried a pot of boiling water from the fire, poured it into the sink and submerged the first of the sheets with a wooden spoon. She filled the pot again with cold water, added the rabbit pieces, the kidneys, the livers, then carrot, turnip, onion, salt and pepper. She carried it back to the main kitchen and hung it over the fire. It was midday. A six-hour simmer. Potatoes added at five. Parsley at the end. Job done. Men fed.", "She returned to the sheets. JP\u2019s first. Before Mam turns up. Peering into the sink. Sniffing around. Bloodhound Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Fee-fi-fo-fum, the", "blood of an Englishman. She laughed and stirred the sheets, adding detergent that she frothed with the spoon. No, Mam. Wrong. She submerged the sheets. The Frenchman, Mam. That\u2019s what you smell. His smell. And my smell. You smell me, Mam. Your own daughter. The lust of her. The lust of her in the Frenchman\u2019s bed. That\u2019s what you smell, Mam. Though you know that. Bloodhound Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. And pretend not to. Turn a blind eye. A blind eye that sees well enough. Sees what it wants to see. As it wants to see. It. Mair\u00e9ad\u2019s bit of summer fun. A transience. That\u2019s all. Nothing more. And God forbid that a child might come of it. God forbid that. A child. A child like James, but speaking French. Rising from my loins to babble in a language nobody can understand. For JP will be gone. Long gone. The disappeared. But don\u2019t worry, Mam. There are condoms. French ones. She laughed. The writer with his French letters. Brought here especially, Mam. Imported. Illegally. Especially. Especially to fuck me, the young widow island woman. She scooped the sheets out of the water and dropped them in again, agitating the stains. Failing that, Mam, failing them, those French condoms, that writer with his French letters, there is always Francis. Francis at the ready. Waiting. In the long grass. Waiting for me to fall flat on my face so that he can pick me up and make me his. Francis the Saviour. Mould me then as he wants me. Has always wanted me. Even before Liam. Mould me, own me and turn any child that comes from me into an Irish-speaking fisherman. No English or French on his boat. The grand man that he is. The grand man prepared to take on the likes of me, the young widow island woman. The grand man ready and waiting for when the condom fails, for when the Frenchman leaves. When my son leaves. The grand man valiantly taking on that mad one still waiting on her drowned husband to rise out of the sea. She spooned the sheets out of the water, set them on the draining board. She added more washing powder, and, with the spoon, shook the tiny white and blue beads into a froth. She dropped the next set of sheets into the still hot water. Mr Lloyd\u2019s. She pushed them down, holding them still as water soaked into the fibres, drowning them as my father drowned kittens, pressing on the bubbles of fabric lifted by rising air, thwarting any escape, saturating each fragment that smells of him, the man who will take away my son, whip him from me, change him so that he returns only as a visitor, each year the visit shorter than before until it becomes annual, biennial, or not", "at all, as it is with my sister, my brothers, siblings in Boston who prefer now to go elsewhere, to see other parts of the world to this lump of rock, sand and shale, and James will in time become them, sending me letters and postcards, pictures of his paintings, of his children, his wife, of his holidays elsewhere, while I stay here, the young widow island woman, waiting for his father to return, waiting for him to return, waiting until I become the middle-aged widow island woman, then the old widow island woman. She pulled the plug and rinsed the sheets in cold water. She squeezed them, twisting and tightening the fabric, water flowing over her red, chafed hands into the draining sink. She carried the sheets outside and draped them across the line that stretched from the house to the wall of rock that marked the village boundary. She returned to the back kitchen. Her mother was at the sink.", "I\u2019ll finish the rest, she said. There\u2019s no hot water, Mam. It\u2019s worse in winter, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She nodded.", "I\u2019ll help James with the henhouse. Get me out for a bit.", "She knocked her foot against the corrugated iron attached to the henhouse coarsely built of stone. Blue twine bound the door to the stone.", "Do you need help, James? Nearly done now.", "Will you go painting after this? Nah. I\u2019ll read for a while.", "Why don\u2019t you go in to Mr Lloyd?", "He doesn\u2019t want me around at the minute. Why not?", "Don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll wait till he goes back out to the hut. What\u2019s he doing?", "I don\u2019t know, Mam. He won\u2019t tell me. What does he want the big canvas for? Don\u2019t know.", "Do you ever want to spy on him? See what he is doing? He\u2019d kick me out.", "Do you see any of his work?", "Sometimes. I\u2019ve seen pencil and charcoal drawings of you. Lying down?", "He laughed.", "You\u2019re sleeping, Mam. A Young Woman Sleeping. Remember? From the Rembrandt.", "She glanced downwards.", "Unless you sleep standing up, Mam.", "She laughed.", "I\u2019m half horse, James. Must be that.", "Are they any good?", "They are. Very.", "He came out of the henhouse and handed her two eggs.", "You missed these, he said. Thank you.", "They walked back towards the house. James pointed at the boat on the horizon.", "They\u2019re back.", "Good to have that rabbit stew, James. I wonder if Miche\u00e1l found the canvas.", "I\u2019ll put the kettle on. You tell Mr Lloyd. And JP?", "Mair\u00e9ad shrugged.", "He\u2019ll come anyway.", "Miche\u00e1l and Francis dropped the rolled canvas on the table. It landed heavily, wrapped in brown paper.", "You\u2019ll break the table with that thing, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "Francis propped the lengths of wood against the dresser.", "Where is himself? said Miche\u00e1l. He\u2019s not in the cottage, said James.", "I saw him leave, said Masson. About half an hour ago. He must have gone for a walk, said James.", "We may wait so.", "I think we should open it, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. We can\u2019t do that, Mam.", "We have a right to know what is coming onto the island, Mair\u00e9ad. Ah, Mam, it\u2019s his stuff.", "It\u2019s our island. My house. I have a right to know what is happening. You can\u2019t do that, Mam.", "Masson patted Mair\u00e9ad\u2019s arm.", "Let your mother at it.", "She\u2019s always at it, said Mair\u00e9ad. Francis began to undo the package. Do you have Sellotape? he said.", "We\u2019ll use string, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "Francis sliced the tape with a knife and folded back the brown paper.", "Keep an eye out, James. He\u2019ll be a while yet.", "The canvas was creamy grey white, layer upon layer of rolled fabric.", "It\u2019s huge, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "What\u2019s it for? said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and Francis, simultaneously, without speaking, lifted the canvas and unrolled it, stretching it across the room, silenced by its reach from the fireplace to the door.", "James, said Francis.

Nor do I, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "It\u2019s only a bit of canvas, said Miche\u00e1l.", "You should never have got it for him, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "Miche\u00e1l sighed and folded his arms.", "Or brought him here, Miche\u00e1l. With his English and his art. Ah, calm down, woman.", "Don\u2019t tell me to calm down when it\u2019s your fault. It\u2019s a bit of canvas, \u00c1ine, for a bit of paint.", "A bit?", "Miche\u00e1l laughed.", "All right, he said. A lot. But for what, Miche\u00e1l?", "I know no more than you, \u00c1ine.", "You must know something, Mair\u00e9ad. Why would I know something, Francis?", "You got that book. The one with the naked women. And?", "Why are you interested in naked women all of a sudden? It\u2019s art, Francis.", "Well, we don\u2019t want it here.", "Tell that to the Pope then too. His place is full of art. The women aren\u2019t naked.", "The angels are, Francis.", "Francis dropped his end of the canvas onto the floor. He pointed at James.", "You must know something.", "James shrugged.", "I don\u2019t.", "Mair\u00e9ad, with Miche\u00e1l\u2019s help, rolled the canvas closed again.", "What does it matter, anyway? she said. He\u2019ll be gone soon and everything will be back to normal.", "Whatever normal is, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. I\u2019ve forgotten at this stage.", "They rewrapped the canvas in the brown paper, pressed the tape together and tied the package with white string.", "Now, said Miche\u00e1l. It looks perfect.", "He\u2019ll know, said James. He notices small things.", "Francis snorted.", "You\u2019ll tell him, anyway, James. Little butler boy.", "James left and sat on the wall outside, waiting for Lloyd\u2019s return.", "Your package has arrived, he said. Wonderful. Thank you, James.", "It\u2019s very big.", "Have you opened it?", "Yes.", "Thought so.", "But Miche\u00e1l has repackaged it. You\u2019d never know. Except that you told me.", "True.", "I wonder why you told me. I don\u2019t know.", "Fetch it for me, would you? I\u2019ll go to the studio.", "He returned to the kitchen and took the package. Francis clapped, slowly.", "Good little butler boy.", "James walked to the studio with the canvas in his arms, blood pulsing at his temples, sweat building under his armpits. He dumped the canvas on", "the table, retrieved the lengths of wood, and stood beside the artist in the studio, the two scrutinising Lloyd\u2019s painting on the easel.", "Your sea is getting better, said James. Thank you.", "The light is coming now from underneath. It\u2019s your good teaching, James.", "Must be that, Mr Lloyd.", "As I said before, James, you have a good eye. Better than yours?", "Lloyd smiled at him.", "Maybe. If you work hard enough.", "James laughed.", "And clean my brushes, Mr Lloyd.", "Yes, James. And put the caps back on the paint tubes. And sweep the floor. I know.", "Lloyd tousled the boy\u2019s hair.", "Open the package, James. Let\u2019s take a look at this canvas.", "They stretched it across the floor.", "It\u2019s perfect, said Lloyd.", "He rubbed the canvas between his fingers.", "It\u2019s already sized.", "James shrugged.", "More time for painting, Mr Lloyd. We\u2019ll build the frame after dinner. Tea, said James.", "Lloyd smiled. Tea, James.", "Lloyd stored the brown paper, the string, and resumed his painting while James quietly, discreetly, knelt in front of his easel chair to work again on Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann, silence enveloping the studio, the cottage, and the cottage next door where Masson had returned to writing, in blue ink, a cup of hot coffee beside him, a relief from the endless tea, from the tension in the kitchen, hidden in the refuge of books and pens, as it was in childhood, in my bedroom with books and pens, away from my father, from my mother, comforted by the silence of my room, the solitariness of my school desk, my schoolbooks, French, English, Classics, Philosophy. Sometimes  Latin.  Even  Greek.  But  never  Arabic.  There  was  no", "discussion of Arabic at school, of Algeria, of things Algerian, so that those texts from the Algerian teacher were pushed to one side, excerpts from newspapers, from the Koran, political and religious tracts that meant nothing to me for I knew nothing of my mother\u2019s country, cared nothing for it so that the translation work to be done for his Thursday classes eluded me, bewildered me. I tried to explain myself to my mother. Explain my indifference to the classes, the teacher, to the need for Arabic. She sighed, pulled on her scarf, and talked to the men and their sons at the tills who pressed even more books into my hands, pamphlets too, some in French, most in Arabic, read these, son, they will explain everything to you, and I read them, as best I could, children\u2019s books on the history of Algeria, on the relationship with France, but none of them explained anything at all, none of them explained what it was like to be the son of a Frenchman, of an Algerian mother, what it was like to be half French, half Algerian, half something, half nothing, a boy in no-man\u2019s land.", "James stood up to look at his painting. He rubbed his knees.", "I\u2019ll never make it as a priest, he said. It\u2019s a sad day for the Church, James.", "Lloyd looked at his work.", "That\u2019s a good piece, James. Definitely one for the exhibition. Thank you.", "How many have you done? That\u2019s the fifth piece ready. One to go, James.", "How many have you done, Mr Lloyd?", "Not sure, James. I\u2019ll select mine when I\u2019m in London. Not before. Why not?", "Makes me work harder if I think they\u2019ll all be included. There\u2019s a logic to that, Mr Lloyd.", "My wife doesn\u2019t agree. Your half-wife.", "He nodded. Smiled.", "She thinks I should home in. Make choices sooner.", "She has a lot of opinions about what you should be doing.", "He laughed.", "Oh, she does, James.", "Will she have opinions about my work? She\u2019ll like you. She\u2019ll love your work.", "They worked together in silence until the evening meal. Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill served the rabbit stew. They ate. Francis cleared his throat and spoke, in English.", "Why do you want the big canvas, Mr Lloyd?", "Lloyd set down his fork, his knife.", "To paint on.", "Yes, but what?", "Island scenes.", "What type of scenes? Why?", "We should know what you are doing.", "With all due respect, Francis, my art has nothing to do with you. It does if it\u2019s about the islanders.", "Lloyd shrugged.", "You\u2019re not an islander.", "I was born here, Mr Lloyd. I spend a lot of time here. I see that.", "So, I do have a say.", "It remains my art, Francis. As I said, nothing to do with you. Francis sat forward.", "You\u2019re wrong there, Mr Lloyd.", "Francis resumed eating. Lloyd ate too, in silence. He drank tea, ate tart and left. James followed.", "That Francis is quite something, James. He is, Mr Lloyd.", "Who is he?", "He\u2019s my father\u2019s brother.", "Beyond that. Why does he have such a say about the place? James shrugged.", "He just does.", "Lloyd stretched the wood along the floor of the studio.", "We need a hammer and a saw, James.", "James returned with the tools and they worked until they had eleven lengths of wood, two long pieces to run along the length of the canvas,", "top and bottom, and nine shorter pieces to frame and stanchion the canvas.", "Has it always been like this? said Lloyd. With Francis in charge? As long as I can remember.", "They wrapped the canvas over the wood.", "I thought it was Miche\u00e1l, said Lloyd. That he was in charge. You\u2019d think that. With the boat and all.", "You would, said Lloyd.", "James held the canvas in place. Lloyd hammered in the nails.", "Miche\u00e1l pays Francis, doesn\u2019t he? He does, Mr Lloyd.", "But Miche\u00e1l isn\u2019t really the boss. Not really. Not on the island.", "Strange place you live, James.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m going with you, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd nodded.", "I\u2019d be going too, James.", "They finished nailing wood onto one width of the canvas.", "It\u2019s going to be huge, Mr Lloyd. It will, James.", "Have you ever done anything as big?", "Lloyd shook his head.", "It\u2019ll be my best work, James. I\u2019m sure of it.", "They moved to the other side of the canvas newspaper ecstasy", "half-wife delight genius of british art full wife delight", "They again wrapped the canvas around the wood and nailed it in place.", "I\u2019d say he has a temper, said Lloyd. Oh, he does, Mr Lloyd.", "I wouldn\u2019t like to get into a fight with him. You\u2019d lose, Mr Lloyd.", "They hammered the shorter cuts into place at each end of the canvas and spaced the seven stanchions evenly along the frame.", "How will I get into art college, Mr Lloyd? You\u2019ll be fine. They know me well.", "Lloyd nailed short cuts of wood along the diagonal of each corner. It holds the canvas upright, James. Stops it falling in on itself. I thought that, all right, Mr Lloyd.", "There\u2019s not much I can tell you, is there, James? Not much, no.", "They stretched the canvas across four kitchen chairs.", "It\u2019s impressive, said James. It\u2019ll be my defining work. What\u2019s it of?", "I\u2019ll show you when I\u2019m finished. If you ever finish.", "Lloyd laughed.", "I\u2019ll still be here next summer, James. I won\u2019t be.", "James walked the length of the canvas.", "How do you paint on something this big, Mr Lloyd? Top marks for spotting the problem, James.", "Lloyd took his biggest brushes from his painting drawer.", "It\u2019s about scale.", "He went to the other room.", "Come and help me, James.", "They removed the mirrored door from the wardrobe and leaned it against the studio wall, opposite the canvas.", "I look at the painting in the reflection in the mirror. Check the scale as I go along.", "Can I watch you work?", "Lloyd shook his head.", "No, James. I\u2019ll be here on my own. You can work in the hut.

He pummelled the ground. You showed them to me, Mr Lloyd. The colours, the light. Taught me how to see, how to see the unseen. Why? So you could steal from me? Take my ideas. Gave me too the feeling of pencil and charcoal on paper, of paint on canvas. And the smell of paint. Of linseed oil. Of white spirits. The sensation of paint drying on my skin. Speckles of grey, green, blue and white across my hands at the end of the working day that feel better than the silver and black scales of fish. Better than their stinking smell. The smell of me if I stay. The smell of me if I do not leave with an Englishman who steals from me.", "He buried his head in his hands and stayed on the edge of the cliff as the clouds came, then the rain.

He sat back into the chair.", "He\u2019s a legitimate target, Mair\u00e9ad.", "You\u2019ve lost me, Francis Gillan. How is an old man with his family a legitimate target?", "He\u2019s a member of the British royal family. A cousin of the Queen. And the young Enniskillen boy?", "Francis refilled his cup.", "As I said, that\u2019s the way.", "So James could be next because he paints with an English artist? He could be.", "Then they\u2019ll be after you because you took money from the English artist. Rowed him with your bare hands to an Irish-speaking island.", "You\u2019re being stupid, Mair\u00e9ad.", "Am I? Where does this end, Francis?", "In a united Ireland, Mair\u00e9ad. One free of British rule. And you\u2019ll blow up innocent children to get it.", "Mair\u00e9ad swallowed the last of her whiskey.", "You\u2019re pathetic, Francis Gillan.", "She gathered the deodorant, coffee and pens ordered by Masson, the paper, pencils and newspapers requested by Lloyd.", "I\u2019ll deliver these, she said.", "She went into Masson\u2019s cottage. He was writing.", "You\u2019re here, Mair\u00e9ad. I am.", "She set the shopping on the edge of the table, away from his papers.", "Coffee? he said.", "She sat down, jerking her head backwards, towards her own house.", "Francis is in there driving me mad.", "Masson laughed.", "Francis is always driving you mad, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She laughed too.", "You\u2019re right, JP. He is.", "What\u2019s he doing to you this time?", "Defending the killing of those children. Of the old woman. A stain on his otherwise perfect day.", "I don\u2019t think he cares, JP. Collateral damage, he calls it.", "Nice and neutral.", "He tidied away his deodorant, coffee and pens but left the paper, pencils, paints and newspapers on the table.", "Are those for Lloyd? They are.", "She laughed.", "Actually, I think it\u2019s James. But Mr Lloyd is paying. What colours this time?", "Mair\u00e9ad pushed the papers to one side.", "More blue, she said. And green. He\u2019s very quiet these days, Mair\u00e9ad. Mr Lloyd?", "Masson nodded.", "Maybe he\u2019s afraid to come out.", "Masson laughed.", "That Francis might get him. He might, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "Masson placed a cup of coffee in front of her, a spoon, some sugar and some milk.", "It\u2019s the last of my coffee. I am honoured, she said.", "They drank.", "It\u2019s good, she said. Thank you.", "He lifted her hand and kissed it.", "So what does he do in there all day, Mair\u00e9ad? We could ask the same of you, JP.", "You could. Though you know me well enough by now.", "Yes, you\u2019re in here hunkered over that recorder like some madman.", "He smiled.", "That\u2019s me.", "Muttering to yourself. Muttering the mutterings of Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "He laughed and kissed her hand, her cheek, ran his fingers through her hair.", "How is your work, anyway? she said.", "Good. Almost finished the comparative work. What does that mean?", "Examining whether the language loss has shifted much over the past five years. Whether the islanders are speaking a lot more English.", "And?", "Some are. Some are not. Whose language has changed?", "Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn hasn\u2019t shifted at all. That\u2019s hardly a surprise.", "My star student.", "Stubborn goat.", "He sipped his coffee.", "Yours though has changed. In what way?", "Your inflections have altered, as though you are listening to English. That\u2019s strange, she said.", "As though you\u2019re listening to Lloyd a lot. Absorbing his English.", "She drank her coffee.", "As though you\u2019re learning it. Somehow.", "He added more milk to his coffee and stirred. What are you doing with Lloyd, Mair\u00e9ad?", "She shook her head.", "Nothing.", "He stared at her, then stood up.", "I need to get back to work, Mair\u00e9ad.", "He gathered the cups.", "How much longer will you stay, JP? You\u2019re here longer than usual. I can\u2019t leave before Lloyd. I need to see his impact on the language. Make sure I don\u2019t start blathering English.", "Or worse, he said. Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. That\u2019ll never happen, JP.", "She lifted the paper, pencils, paints and newspapers.", "Will you come tonight? he said. I don\u2019t know, she said. We\u2019ll see.", "I don\u2019t see so much of you any more, Mair\u00e9ad.", "There\u2019s a lot going on. James isn\u2019t going back to school. I heard.", "Art college in London. Living with Lloyd. Quite a change for him. For you.", "She picked at the edges of the newspaper.", "What do you think, JP? Do you think James should go?", "He shrugged.", "I know nothing about it, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She shredded a corner, dropping newsprint to the floor.", "I hope it\u2019s the right thing, she said. With everything going on. That he\u2019ll be safe, JP.", "It\u2019ll be a hard time to be Irish in London, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She nodded.", "It\u2019s always a hard time to be Irish in London.", "She opened the door.", "Try and see what he\u2019s doing on that canvas, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She laughed.", "You want me to spy on him?", "I do, Mair\u00e9ad. Come back with top information. I won\u2019t see anything. He has his curtains closed. What is James saying?", "Nothing. He\u2019s out in the hut. Banished?", "Mair\u00e9ad smiled.", "He spends all day out there drawing. The pair of them will end up mad.", "That\u2019s us all, JP.", "She tapped on the door and pushed it, but it was locked. She knocked. Lloyd pulled back the curtain, peered at her and opened the door. She handed him the bundle of paper, paints and pencils.", "Thank you, he said.", "She turned to leave.", "Do you want to see it, Mair\u00e9ad? I do, Mr Lloyd.", "She slipped though the half-opened door. She followed him into the studio, the dusky daylight augmented by four lanterns on the floor. He stood to one side so that she could see herself, naked but for her scarf, reaching up for an imagined apple, her son and mother either side of her, beyond them her grandmother with Francis and Miche\u00e1l, and in the background a priest, a cross and an upturned boat, three men scattered", "around it. She inhaled sharply, briefly, then closed her eyes. Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Incantation. She opened her eyes.", "The island, she said.", "She looked again at the painting, at Mountbatten and the children on", "Shadow V, the soldiers dead on the beach, beside the seals.", "What do you think?", "It\u2019s wonderful, she said. Beautiful. And Liam?", "She bowed her head.", "He\u2019s always with me, Mr Lloyd.", "She walked from one end of the painting to the other, absorbing the blues, greys, greens, browns and blacks, but the splashes too of vibrant colour, yellow, orange, pink, red and gold, soaking in his inclusion of hens, dogs, cats, fish, birds and seals, of the island pig and her litter, and the island milking cow. The heifer too. Swimming in the sea by herself. A sea tinged intermittently with red. Blood red.", "It\u2019s very, very good, she said.", "He bowed, slightly.", "Thank you, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She reached out to touch the painting, her hand attracted by the glow of her skin, the young widow island woman as they have never seen me, my skin, my body, shimmering with energy, with vibrancy, a vitality that will be whisked away from here, carried off to live in London, in Paris, in New York, to live as Liam and I were going to live, vibrant, vital, flitting from one gallery to the next, from theatre to bookshop, wine glasses in hand, red for me, white for him, though we had tasted neither, drinking whiskey and tea on our wedding day, laughing that it would soon be wine and champagne in Boston, where his brother lived, where his brother had earned enough to buy tickets for Liam, for me, for our child, so that all that remained was the visa, the one that arrived after the drowning, the visa that Francis wanted to take as his, me with it, though I was not having it, not having him, so that talk of Boston faded, and talk of wine, of champagne, of theatre, of galleries was washed away by winter rains. But I can go now, Liam. Leave. Get off this rock. Escape. But stay too, setting the kettle on the fire, the day in motion, waiting on you to come out of the sea, into our bed, into me.", "Lloyd put his hand on hers, gently.", "It\u2019s still wet, he said.", "She dropped her hand and again walked the length of the canvas, up and down, several times, smiling, then laughing, the young widow island woman as they have never seen me, those mainland women, over there.", "She shook Lloyd\u2019s hand.", "Thank you, she said. It\u2019s perfect.", "He smiled at her. He kissed her then on her right cheek.", "It\u2019s my best work, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She left, walking a distance from Masson\u2019s window in the hope that he would not see her. He came out after her. He called to her.", "So what did you find out, Mair\u00e9ad? About what?", "About what he\u2019s doing in there? Oh, nothing.", "What were you doing in there?", "He asked me to tidy up. To clean cups. Did you?", "I did, she said. And I swept the floor. He\u2019s a messy man.", "Masson remained as he was, leaning against the door frame to watch her walk away, leaving him quickly, hurriedly, but then slowing as she approached her own house, her own door, the changes in her gait the same as my mother\u2019s each time she left the old men and their sons at the tills, rushing from their shops, from their streets, fretting that my father would pass in a post van, on a post bicycle, that he would find her where he did not want her, dressed as he did not want her dressed, walking quickly, trotting, jogging until she was back again in our area, near our apartment block, and then she slowed, her body heavy, lugubrious, her shoulders slumped as we approached the building, as we climbed the concrete stairs, as she turned the key in the door, relieved each time to find the shared home empty of him with enough time for her to change out of long skirts into shorter ones, out of darker colours into the brighter clothes that he preferred though she was increasingly comfortable with covered legs and a scarf hanging loosely over the back of her head. Just as she was wearing that evening, the evening we got home to find him already there. Steeped in beer and French television, demanding to know where we had been and why she, my mother, was wearing those dark clothes and scarf when he had told her not to. And she told him. Straight", "out. Your son is learning Arabic. Classical Arabic. Literary Arabic. The language of my people, my culture, my history. He sprung out of the armchair and shoved her, my mother, against the wall, shouting that his son was French and would be raised as French. Speak French. Read French. Play with French children. That his son would never learn Arabic. And that he was anyway sick of all this Arabic crap, this Algerian crap, that fucking couscous that she cooked for hours, steaming the apartment until condensation dribbled down the windows. And all I want is a decent rabbit stew and apple flan. To eat as my friends eat. As the bosses in my office eat. And he lunged then at her books. At her newspapers. Tearing them. Ripping them. Then at her. At my mother. Slapping her. Across the face. Punching her. In the stomach. In the chest. Knocking her to the floor. Kicking her. My son is French and will eat French food. He unbuckled his belt, yanked it from the hooks of his jeans. He lifted the black leather into the air above her, my mother, my beloved mother cowered into the corner of the kitchen beside the bin, emptied before she left, a fresh liner inserted. The belt came down, through the air and onto her back. She yelped. He lifted the belt again. It came down a second time, on her legs. And he shouted. You Arab slut. The belt rose again. I should never have married you, you Arab whore. The belt landed, on her hip bone. I should have left you there with that child inside you, left you in that godforsaken country. The belt rose, the belt fell, my mother a tightened ball, hands and arms over her face, over her head. I should have married a Frenchwoman. None of this Arabic crap. The belt on her back. My son will speak French. On her legs. Read French. On her back again. Lashing her. Legs. Hip. Back. Buttocks. Shoulder. My. Son. Will. Be. French.", "He stopped then, and, panting, gathered the belt into his hand. My mother sobbed, quietly, as quietly as she could and reached her hand towards my foot. I stared down at her, my mouth open, my body still, silent, speaking neither the tongue of my mother nor the tongue of my father, watching as my father rethreaded his belt, aware as he returned to his beer and his television, as my mother let go of my foot, that my father tongue had become my mother tongue and my mother tongue a silence for she spoke little after that. She stopped reading too, sitting instead at the window looking over the distant sea, leaving the apartment only to fetch food, returning every Thursday with rabbit and apples. My father praised her", "cooking. And her shorter skirts. And the bright colours of her clothes. He said that I was free to be as French as he was. A proper French boy, he said. Eating proper French food.", "He saw James then coming back from the cliffs, a rabbit in each hand, the sketchpad under his arm.", "You\u2019ve been busy, James, he said.", "Masson stepped away from the doorframe.", "I\u2019ll follow you, he said. See if there\u2019s a cup of tea.", "James stretched the rabbits across the table. He set down his sketchpad.", "A handsome pair, said Miche\u00e1l.", "Francis picked up the sketchpad and flicked through the pages. James stood still, his hands by his side.", "I hear you\u2019re off to London to be an artist, he said. I am.", "Let\u2019s hope you\u2019re a better artist than you are a fisherman.", "James laughed.", "That\u2019s the hope, Uncle Francis. When are you leaving? said Miche\u00e1l.", "Soon enough, said James. As soon as Mr Lloyd\u2019s work dries. What\u2019s he working on, James? said Masson.", "James shrugged.", "He\u2019s being very mysterious, said Masson.", "No big mystery, said James. He\u2019s just working on his own. Artists do that.", "Francis dropped the sketchpad onto the table.", "You\u2019ll be doing a lot of that in London. What? said James.", "Being on your own. Lonesome Irish lad stuff. What do you know about it? said James.", "I know enough, said Francis. You\u2019ve barely left this place.", "James drank tea, ate two scones, and carried a serving to Lloyd, his sketchpad tucked again under his arm. He kicked at the door with his foot. Lloyd opened the door and let him in.", "Thank you, James.", "You\u2019re welcome, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd took the food and nudged his head towards the studio.", "Go in. Take a look. Tell me what you think.", "James again walked its length.", "I like it more every time I see it, he said. That\u2019s good.", "Lloyd stayed at the studio door, eating and drinking.", "I can\u2019t wait to see it in daylight, said James. That will be a good moment.", "Can I open the curtains?", "No, James. Too many disapproving eyes. It\u2019s a long list, all right.", "Lloyd smiled.", "Your grandmother will throw me off the cliff if she sees this. She will, Mr Lloyd.", "And Francis will shoot me.", "He will. You\u2019ll be well dead from the pair of them.", "Lloyd stood beside him.", "Maybe Francis will like it, James. All that soldier blood running into the sea.", "He\u2019ll see only my mother. Then himself. You\u2019re right, James.", "James laughed.", "There\u2019ll be steam coming out his ears, Mr Lloyd. You sound like you might enjoy that.", "Oh, I will.", "What about your great-grandmother?", "Hard to know. Not as locked into the priests\u2019 way of thinking as my grandmother.", "But she prays?", "Oh, she does that. Night and day. But to God. Little time for the priests and their rules.", "A direct line, then.", "No middlemen for her, Mr Lloyd.", "James resumed painting. Lloyd remained in front of his canvas scrutinising Mair\u00e9ad, the glow of her skin and its reflected shimmer on the islanders around her, on the animals, the rock, on the wind-burnt grass. He walked alongside the canvas, checking it, analysing it, and looking at it through the mirror for scale and evenness, muttering as he", "examined his work, to himself, to James, it\u2019ll be my best work, James, my masterpiece, this mammoth work a comeback and calling card that will turn the head of a half-wife, turn a forgotten, dismissed, overlooked artist into a celebrity, an equal to Freud, to Auerbach, to Bacon. No, he laughed. No. Better. Better than all of them. Better than those dealers\u2019 darlings, this seminal work of mine pushing theirs aside, rendering their work, rendering them, so insignificant that my half-wife becomes my full wife and my full wife promotes me, hangs this groundbreaking work from the walls of her esteemed gallery, that coveted space, and extols me on opening night as the Gauguin of the northern hemisphere, as the existentialist of British art who lived on a remote Irish island for almost four months, alone, isolated, a hermit in a hut, without electricity, without running water, on a diet of fish and potatoes, lauding me as the great British artist who stripped everything back to ask the same questions as Gauguin, D\u2019o\u00f9 venons-nous? Que sommes-nous? O\u00f9 allonsnous? Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? And here you have it, ladies and gentlemen in your silk scarves and Rolex watches, ladies and gentlemen of the press, of The Times, the Telegraph, the Guardian, the BBC, the questions are presented once more by this great British artist. But not in the French colony of Tahiti where Gauguin painted. Closer to home. Closer to all of us here this evening. The questions he poses are about Ireland. About us. About the British relationship with Ireland. The former British colony of Ireland. Lloyd, like Gauguin, is prodding at the questions still unanswered of how we exist together on this earth, on these islands, human, animal, spirit, all of us passing through the same stages of birth, life and death, side by side, cheek by jowl, intertwined in this coexistence, this co-dependency that he understood properly, thoroughly, as he lived on the island, on a rock surrounded by ocean where existence is stripped back to essential living, relationships too laid bare on the remote rock, and he asks us through this magnificent work, no, challenges us, to reflect on our relationship with the earth, with each other, and on the relationship between Britain and Ireland, the sea between us tinged still with the blood of ordinary people, of men doing the dishes at home, of women out shopping with their mothers, of children on a boat with their grandfather, the blood too of teenage English soldiers and young Irish men who call themselves \u2018Freedom Fighters\u2019, the violence and chaos of those deaths, of that", "bloodshed, living alongside the beauty of the people, of the landscape, a disrupted, upended Garden of Eden, a suspended state, a state of unfinished business where the ghosts of the past shimmer still in the present. A spontaneous round of applause from the men and women in their silk scarves and Rolex watches, from the men and women of the press. Lloyd has created this magnificent work, ladies and gentlemen, by drawing not only on Gauguin \u2013 with a nod en passant to Picasso\u2019s Guernica \u2013 but by drawing too on primitive art and naive art, his long- time interest in these art forms stirred by his relationship with James Gillan, an island boy whose astonishing naive art is also shown here this evening. Lloyd befriended James, known too by his Irish name of S\u00e9amus, and was struck by the boy\u2019s natural ability as an artist. By his natural capacity to see as an artist, to interpret as an artist. From the beginning, the boy\u2019s work reminded Lloyd of the work of ancient Chinese artists who painted in a linear style that gave equal representation to all, to people, to animals, to spirits, a perspective abandoned in European art in the Renaissance, when the linear narrative that we see too in ancient cave paintings was abandoned to allow the artist to focus instead on a single point, a single person, creating a dominant position in the painting. A dominant position in society. Lloyd, this great British artist, is unpicking all of those assumptions and habits in our ways of seeing and returning us to the more egalitarian roots of the naive period. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me this evening in raising a glass to toast Lloyd, this great British artist whose work is as radical today in London as Manet was in Paris when he presented Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe to the Salon. As Manet mixed the classical with the modern, Lloyd has radically blended primitive, naive, impressionist and post-impressionist art to create something utterly original and new.", "Lloyd smiled. Then laughed. What\u2019s funny, Mr Lloyd.", "My wife loves telling people what to think. Your half-wife.", "My wife.", "Lloyd stepped across the room to stand by the easel. He looked at James\u2019s painting of the cliffs, at the pinks and blues sparkling in the sunlight.", "It\u2019s good, James. I think we should include it.", "That will be my sixth work, so.", "James carried the painting to the corner of the room to dry. He returned", "Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann to the easel.", "Bit more work to do on this one, he said. I like it very much, James.", "I won\u2019t be selling it.", "Lloyd nodded.", "Then that\u2019s the one that everybody will want to buy.", "James resumed work on his mother, on her eyes, on the lines shimmering under the surface of her skin, soon to rise, to break through.", "How big is the gallery, Mr Lloyd?", "The perfect size for what we are doing. And very central. People love going to it.", "Will I be there?", "Of course you will. It\u2019s your work. Do I need a suit? A jacket?", "Just as you are, James, is perfect.", "James nodded.", "I could wear the jumper my mother is knitting. Ideal.", "It\u2019ll be brand new. Perfect.", "I\u2019ll walk around the gallery as the island boy in his island jumper. You\u2019ll be good at this, James.", "I will, Mr Lloyd.", "Would your mother come to London, James? For the exhibition.", "James shook his head.", "She won\u2019t leave here. Ever?", "She\u2019s waiting on my father.", "Lloyd startled.", "But he\u2019s dead, James. Drowned. She\u2019s still waiting.", "James pointed at his painting.", "They\u2019re all waiting, he said. All waiting for those men to come out of the sea.", "Maybe you should rename it. The Waiting Room.", "James looked again at his work. Maybe I should, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd returned to his own canvas.", "I think I will consider this done now, James. Let it fully dry. How long will that take?", "A few days.", "And then we\u2019ll go, Mr Lloyd? Yes, James. Then we\u2019ll go.", "Lloyd looked again at his work.", "You have inspired me, James. With your linear narratives. That\u2019s not linear, Mr Lloyd.", "It is, James.", "My mother is still at the centre. Everybody else in a supporting role. You\u2019re wrong, James.", "It looks like an album cover, Mr Lloyd.", "James laughed.", "The Boomtown Rats, Mr Lloyd. Bob and the Rats. Mair\u00e9ad and Islanders.", "Lloyd shook his head.", "No, no, James. It\u2019s much more than that.", "Maybe, Mr Lloyd. But it\u2019s nothing like my work. I think it is, James.", "In my paintings everybody is equal, everybody has a story. It\u2019s not like that in yours. Mam is top dog.", "She is very beautiful.", "James shrugged.", "That doesn\u2019t give her greater value, Mr Lloyd. To me it does.", "Then you\u2019re not painting like me, said James. You\u2019re painting as yourself. An Englishman on an Irish island.", "What does that mean?", "You\u2019re turning the island into something it isn\u2019t. You\u2019ve lost me, James.", "Mam isn\u2019t the centre of things. She isn\u2019t top dog. So who is?", "James shrugged.", "It changes. All the time. Winter. Summer. The job to be done.", "Lloyd shook his head.", "You\u2019re deluding yourself, James. Francis is top dog. Only when he\u2019s here, Mr Lloyd.", "But he\u2019s always coming back. That\u2019s true.", "Anyway, James, it\u2019s my interpretation of the island.", "That\u2019s grand, Mr Lloyd. It\u2019s just nothing to do with my work. My work is different. Yours is like everybody else\u2019s work.", "That\u2019s not very kind, James.", "A beautiful woman at the centre. Everything dotted around that.", "Painting done. Job done. You\u2019re all doing that. Have been for centuries.", "You know very little about art, James.", "James shrugged.", "I\u2019ve been reading, Mr Lloyd. Looking. I know enough.", "I really find your tone objectionable, James. This art is utterly original.", "Is it, Mr Lloyd? Yes, James, it is.", "James shrugged again.", "To me, it\u2019s a version of what has gone before. An amalgamation.", "James laughed.", "Magpie art, Mr Lloyd.", "And yours will be better, James?", "I suppose we\u2019ll find that out when I get to London. I suppose we will, James.", "Hugh O\u2019Halloran, a twenty-eight-year-old Catholic father of five, dies in hospital on Monday, September 10th from injuries received two days earlier when he was beaten by a gang of republican men with a hurling stick and a pickaxe handle.", "It\u2019s going mad up there, Mam.", "It is, Mair\u00e9ad. Attacking and killing their own.", "Mair\u00e9ad mopped where her mother had swept.", "Francis would say our own. He would, Mair\u00e9ad.", "But you\u2019re not.", "I\u2019m not.", "Mair\u00e9ad reached the mop under the chairs.", "You used to.", "I did.", "Not any more, Mam?", "I don\u2019t know what to think any more, Mair\u00e9ad.", "They heard a tapping against the dresser. It was Lloyd. Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill turned off the radio.", "I have a question, he said.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill began to shout for James. Mair\u00e9ad stopped her.", "F\u00e1g \u00e9 mar a bhfuil s\u00e9, she said. Yes, Mr Lloyd? When will Miche\u00e1l be back?", "Am\u00e1rach. Tomorrow. B\u2019fh\u00e9idir. Maybe.", "Thank you. I will leave then. Go back with him.", "Mair\u00e9ad nodded.", "What about James? she said.", "He wants to come with me, Mair\u00e9ad. She reached the mop under the dresser.", "Tuigim. I understand. Will I take him, Mair\u00e9ad?", "She worked from left to right, a single sweep, and then back to the open floor, towards the door, where Lloyd was still standing.", "Do you want him to come with me, Mair\u00e9ad?", "She pushed the mop towards him.", "Idir, she said.", "What does that mean? Between, she said.", "She mopped around his feet.", "Between you and James, Mr Lloyd.", "She forced the mop between his feet.", "Your decision, Mr Lloyd. Not mine.", "Lloyd stepped away from her and left, for the cliffs, walking the route of that first evening, through the vegetable patch, by the lake and up the hill, no longer noticing the steepness in the back of his legs, the wind through his hair, his body acclimatised and bent slightly forward at the hips to walk as the islanders walked. He reached the top and fell to his knees, to his belly, leaning over the edge to look once more, one final time, at the rock shimmering in the evening light, at the birds preparing for night", "as it was", "in the beginning is now", "He laughed.", "self-portrait: finding god", "He stayed until the sun left, soaking in the clefts, the hollows, remembering them and the last of the light flitting across the rock, the tumult of sea, of wave after wave crashing against the rock, gnawing at the earth, its force and power reverberating through the cliff into his bones", "and ever shall be", "He shivered and stood up. He walked to the hut, arriving in darkness. He lit the lamps and moved about in light and shadow, the hut tidier than he had left it, his drawings stacked into four neat piles, the pillow, blanket and mattress returned to the bed, the table cleaned. He lit the fire, shook the tea caddy, rattling the teaspoon and dried leaves. He looked inside.", "Enough for a final cup of tea. He tasted the water in the bucket fresh enough", "my thanks, james", "He put water on to boil and took the drawings to sit in front of the still stumbling fire. He lifted a bundle. Birds. Terns with heads that were too big, gulls with heads that were too small. He fed them to the fire, a surge of light and heat eradicating his early ignorance, his need for tuition by the island boy, rude now, cocky in his assertions of amalgamation and magpie art. He laughed", "cheeky pup", "He picked up more drawings, of the light on the sea, on the cliffs, and threw sheet after sheet to the flames.", "self-portrait: playing god", "The water boiled, he made tea and returned to the fire, sipping at the hot blackness as he sifted through the drawings of Mair\u00e9ad, keeping most of them to take with him, to include in any future exhibition on the evolution of his work. He turned his attention to the fourth pile, of James, of James with the rabbits. He moved through the sheets, pleased with them, with the freshness of life and death, delighted by the vibrancy, the vitality, but then paused. It was not his work. He scrutinised a sheet. It\u2019s James\u2019s drawing. His hand. Not mine. His drawings slipped among mine, his drawings of rabbits freshly killed exuding a vividness missing from mine. He scrunched up the sheet. Then another. Six sheets. Seven sheets. He threw them on the fire, staring as the flames smothered and devoured the boy\u2019s art, art that is better than my art.", "He gathered the sketches of Mair\u00e9ad, extinguished the lamps and pulled the door of the hut tightly behind him, his last time on the promontory. He glanced around, but only briefly, cursorily, and hurried back towards the village, muttering, mumbling, swearing as he walked, pummelling his fist against his thigh, against James, the apprentice better than his master. He barged into his cottage, into his studio, and lit the lamps along the floor. He squeezed fresh paint onto his cleaned palette and painted over James, the boy no longer holding the rabbit and paintbrushes but four fish, two in each hand.", "self-portrait: being god", "He quenched the lanterns and went to bed, though Mair\u00e9ad was still up, by the fire, sewing the back of the jumper to the front, grey wool in the darning needle, stitching one side tightly to the other, closing off gaps, shutting out the wind, the rain that comes sideways at the island men. She added the sleeves then, first the right, then the left, and stretched the completed jumper across her lap, stroking the blackberries that will keep him warm as he crosses the Irish Sea, the diamonds that will shield the centre of the chest as he waits in the wind for the train to take him to London. Away. From here. From me. Though I will travel with you, James. Alongside you on the boat, on the train, alongside you on the white walls as we hang together in London, mother and son, an exhibition, a celebration, my beauty captured before it fades, yours as it", "grows, blossoms, an Irish child artist into a great Irish artist, for your rabbits are better than his rabbits, James. Your birds, too. Their movements through the air more vibrant in your drawings. As though you understand them more. Have studied them more. She tucked the sleeves behind the back, and folded the jumper. You\u2019re not better than him yet, James. But you will be. In time. She smiled. And he knows that, James. That you will be better than him. In time. And you have time. Lots of time. Time that your father never had. She laughed. He never wanted to be a fisherman either, James. Hated the sea. Hated boats. But that was all he knew. Had the chance to know.", "She returned the wool, the knitting needles and the darning needle to the basket by the chair and stood up. She laid the jumper on the kitchen table for James to see in the morning and went out into the night air, the stars abundant, the moon on the cusp of fullness. It was cold, the summer gone, though still she dawdled, taking her time to reach Masson\u2019s cottage, her eyes resting on the stars and moon, relishing the quiet of others sleeping on the island while she was awake, the place entirely hers, as it had been ours, Liam, out on the cliffs, down by the sea, across in the hut, on the floor in front of the fire where I lay for the artist, where I lay with you, where James was made. She smiled. Our own little artwork, Liam. Our collaboration. She pushed at the door of Masson\u2019s house. She went inside, the mildew thwarted by the smell of coffee fragments burning still on the stone hearth. One last time, JP, for you will not be back, and I will not see you again, for there will be no camera crews, no newspaper writers, nobody rushing up here to meet Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn, the last Irish speaker on the island, for nobody will care now about your study, JP, about the language, its history, its demise, the shift towards bilingualism in this most remote corner of Europe. The camera crews, the newspaper writers will come to this land only to talk of soldiers and guns and bombs, the story now, to write stories of death, of hatred, of fear, of tit-for-tat, retaliation on top of retaliation, a downward bilious spiral until the killers stalking the streets in the dead of night no longer remember what it is they are retaliating.", "She climbed the stairs and slipped into his bed. In the morning, James saw the jumper.", "Thanks, Mam.", "It\u2019ll keep you warm, James.", "I\u2019ll wear it on opening night, he said.", "She wrapped her arms around herself.", "You\u2019ll look very smart, James. James Gillan, The Island Painter.", "He carried breakfast to Lloyd and knocked on the door. Lloyd didn\u2019t respond. The door unlocked, he went inside, the cottage stilled by sleep. He quietly set the breakfast on the table and went to the studio, to check the dryness of Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann, to absorb the smells of oil and paint that will soon be my smells, the Irish island boy in London, no longer smelling of salted water, dead fish and rotting rabbit blood, but of lemon ochre, of carmine, of Prussian blue, Persian blue, of grenadine, Payne\u2019s grey, olive green, scarlet vermillion, of linseed oil and white spirits. He laughed. My new smells. My new way. No more school. No more priests. No more Francis. And no more fish. He touched Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann. Dry. Ready to go. One of six. Five more to select. To take with me. The rest I will leave behind, here, in this room, for Mam to find when she comes to clean, to scrape the paint off the walls, off the floor, to return the room, the cottage, to how it had been at the beginning of the summer, before Lloyd arrived, before I knew about painting instead of fishing.", "He walked behind Lloyd\u2019s canvas to reach his paintings in the corner. He carried them back across the room and set them out on the floor, under the window. Twenty-two paintings. Time to choose, James Gillan. To select your darlings. He walked from one side of the room to the other looking down, choosing but tracking too the development of his art, the rapid shift over one summer from childish, primitive art to representative art, distillations of island life. He examined his paintings of Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, of Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn, and stepped across the room to look at Lloyd\u2019s canvas, to scrutinise how much the English artist had copied him. He laughed. Utterly. Completely. Their clothes, their gestures, their postures identical, as though Lloyd had come down in the middle of the night to copy from me. And then he halted. In front of himself. His altered self. Why had I not seen it sooner? As soon as I came into the room? A boy with fish. An island boy with fish. No longer an artist, an apprentice. No longer holding brushes but fish. I am a boy with fish. An island boy. Hunter. Gatherer. Provider. But not artist. He doesn\u2019t see me as an artist. Does not want me to be seen as an artist. For there is only one artist. And it is not you, James Gillan.", "He heard Lloyd then, coming down the stairs. He stilled his breath, his anger, and slipped back into the kitchen to stand by the table, his hands behind his back, his face static. James Gillan, little butler boy.", "Morning, James. Morning.", "Lloyd poured tea.", "Would you like some?", "James shook his head and turned to look through the window, at the sea.", "It\u2019s a good day, said Lloyd. It is.", "Lloyd lifted his bowl of porridge.", "I do miss the chairs, James. I\u2019d say that, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd ate. James was silent.", "So what do you think? said Lloyd. Of what? said James.", "I heard you, James. In the studio.", "James looked at his feet.", "Why did you do that, Mr Lloyd?", "Lloyd spooned more porridge into his mouth.", "Do what?", "You painted over me. Turned me into a fisherman. It\u2019s my painting, James.", "James turned to him.", "It\u2019s my identity, Mr Lloyd. And I\u2019m not a fisherman. It\u2019s a representation of the island, James. Nothing more. It\u2019s much more.", "It\u2019s not.", "It\u2019s how you want me to be. How you want me to be seen. You\u2019re being ridiculous, James.", "You\u2019re the artist, Mr Lloyd. I\u2019m the island boy who fishes. James, you\u2019re over-interpreting this.", "James lifted his face, holding onto tears welling in his eyes.", "An artist can\u2019t over-interpret, Mr Lloyd. You\u2019re not an artist, James. Not yet.", "And I won\u2019t be if you present me like this. You need to calm down, James.", "I\u2019m supposed to be part of the exhibition. An artist in the exhibition. And you will be.", "James ran his hands through his hair, using the heel of his palms to whip the water from his eyes.", "No, Mr Lloyd. I\u2019m an exhibit. A fisherman.", "Lloyd shrugged.", "It\u2019s a representation of the island. Nothing more.", "Lloyd poured more tea.", "It\u2019s me as you want me to be seen, Mr Lloyd. As you want me to be interpreted.", "Lloyd added milk and drank.", "As I said, you\u2019re not an artist yet, James.", "And I won\u2019t be if you present me as a fisherman.", "Lloyd gathered the crockery and pushed it towards James.", "I\u2019ll be packing today, he said.", "James shook his head.", "But the canvas is still wet, Mr Lloyd.", "Only in parts, James. It\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll put dry canvas over the wet parts.", "The boy inhaled, deeply.", "Does that work, Mr Lloyd? Well enough. Stops it sticking.", "James lifted the dishes from the table.", "I\u2019ll fold the canvas tomorrow, James. Will you help me?", "James shrugged.", "Maybe.", "He\treturned\tto\tthe\thouse,\tto\tthe\tback\tkitchen.\tHis\tmother\tand grandmother were baking.", "Can you get some rabbits today, James?", "James splashed water across his face.", "I can, Granny.", "The men are coming across, she said. So I hear.", "And you\u2019ll be going across with them. That\u2019s the plan.", "You, Mr Lloyd and JP. He nodded.", "It\u2019ll be a busy boat, Granny. And a quiet island, James.", "James walked towards the door.", "Do you want two or three rabbits? Three.", "He hunkered down in the grass and waited, the sun warming his back, the corncrakes calling still to each other, though the puffins were already gone, out at sea on their way south, their path already mapped. As mine had been. Miche\u00e1l\u2019s boat tomorrow, my drawings and paintings with me, waving goodbye to my mother, my grandmother, my great-grandmother, three women on the slipway, in darkened clothes, huddled, weeping, Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann, At the Pier, and then onwards, across the country to the other sea, the sea smaller, the boat bigger. A rabbit stepped into the net. He yanked it tight, grabbed the thrashing rabbit by its hind legs and hammered it to the ground, smashing its head. He picked the rabbit out of the net, set the trap again and sat back down to wait. And then the train to London, to Lloyd\u2019s house to live with the smell of paint and the half-wife who is becoming again the full wife. Another rabbit came out of the hole. It bounced into the net. He snared it. A third rabbit emerged, despite the commotion. Stupid fucking rabbits. Stupid thick rabbits. He grabbed the third rabbit with his hands, lifted it into the air and slammed it against the earth. I\u2019m sick of rabbit stew, anyway. Sick of eating the same fucking thing. He kicked the third rabbit, although it was already dead. Sick of being the hunter. The gatherer. He swung the second rabbit over his head and smashed it on the ground, blood splattering across the grass. Sick of being the provider. The rabbit killer.", "He walked back to the village.", "A good slew, James, said Mair\u00e9ad. It is, Mam.", "You\u2019ll lose the knack of it in London. I won\u2019t miss it, Mam.", "You will. More than you know. Then I\u2019ll kill them in Hyde Park.", "Mair\u00e9ad laughed.", "They\u2019ll have you arrested.", "She laughed again, burying her head in her hands.", "Can you imagine the faces of the children? Of their mothers?", "I\u2019ll be in jail forever, Mam. The Irish Rabbit Killer.", "They leaned into each other.", "I\u2019ll miss you, James.", "I know, Mam.", "Miche\u00e1l and Francis arrived. They dropped the shopping on the table, beside the rabbits.", "Another feast, said Miche\u00e1l. My last supper, said James. It\u2019ll be a good one, James.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill set the teapot, scones and crockery on the table. They sat down.", "Are you nervous, James? No, Miche\u00e1l.", "It will be exciting, said Mair\u00e9ad. A new life. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this one, said Francis. There is if you don\u2019t like fishing, said James.", "Mair\u00e9ad ruffled his hair.", "So what\u2019s the name of the school you\u2019re going to? said Miche\u00e1l. I don\u2019t know. He hasn\u2019t said.", "And when will you start? I don\u2019t know that either.", "You don\u2019t know much, do you? said Francis. I\u2019ll know soon enough, said James.", "You\u2019re taking an awful risk, James. Why\u2019s that, Francis?", "Going off with an Englishman you barely know.", "James shrugged.", "I know him well enough.", "And being Irish in London, said Francis. He\u2019ll be grand, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "The police are picking up Irish lads all the time. For doing nothing. I\u2019ll be quiet, said James. They\u2019ll barely notice me.", "Francis shook his head.", "They\u2019ll notice you, James. They\u2019ll know everything about you. There\u2019s nothing to know, Francis.", "They\u2019ll make it up, James. Even when there\u2019s nothing to know.", "James finished his tea, his scones and stood up.", "I\u2019ll take some to JP and Mr Lloyd, he said.", "He carried two cups of tea and a plate of four scones, stopping first by Masson who was clearing his desk.", "Perfect, James. Just what I need. When will you be back, JP?", "Next spring. When my book is published. I\u2019ll bring television and newspaper people to meet Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "I won\u2019t be here, JP. I\u2019m going to London. So I hear. It\u2019s exciting for you.", "Thanks, JP. Though Francis is giving out. Francis is always giving out.", "He went then to Lloyd, in the studio. He was throwing used paint tubes and pencils from the drawer onto the floor. James handed him the food, the tea visibly cold.", "I stopped by JP.", "Not to worry, James.", "Lloyd ate, drank. James stepped towards his work, still on the floor.", "I\u2019ll pick my six, he said.", "Lloyd nodded.", "James selected Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann and five others, mostly on paper, of rabbits, of the village, of the cliffs, of boats on the sea, and What the Ant Saw. He laid the six paintings between sheets of cardboard and, with white string, tied them into a bundle that he set on the floor by the studio door, beside Lloyd\u2019s easel, already collapsed and ready for the journey.", "That\u2019s done, Mr Lloyd. It\u2019s good work, James.", "James nodded.", "A good start, Mr Lloyd.", "James gathered his remaining paintings into a pile that he returned to the far corner of the room.", "Do you want me to sweep, Mr Lloyd?", "Lloyd shook his head.", "It\u2019s a bit soon, James. But get the brush, and I\u2019ll do it when I\u2019m ready.", "James returned with the yard brush.", "It\u2019ll be a good exhibition, Mr Lloyd. A great one. My best.", "James pointed at his paintings, still by the door.", "Will I put them in your suitcase?", "Not yet, James. I\u2019ll include them when I am doing my own. James left, with the cup and plate, and Lloyd resumed his work emptying the drawer, repacking the mahogany chest, though most of its original contents had been used or worn down, the paints, turpentine and linseed oil emptied and drained, the cloths dirtied and hardened, the tape, primers, pencils, pens, inks and charcoal depleted. The jars and bottles were too grubby to bother carrying back, though the small easel, palette, palette knives and brushes were in good order, well used but still functioning. His black apron was pristine, unworn.", "He slipped his drawings between the pages of his books and packed the books into the chest. He covered them with a layer of clothing, then added his canvases and paintings, layers of paper and cardboard between them, rolls of shirts and socks tucked around them to hold the artworks in place. He closed the lid of the chest, locked it.", "He swept the floor, cursorily, pushing the detritus of his stay into a pile under the window, screwed up sheets of paper, used tubes of paints, jars, containers, cloths. He went into the back yard to return the brush. Masson was sitting on a chair, his eyes closed, fragments of turf scattered about his feet.", "I gather that you too are leaving tomorrow, said Masson. I am, said Lloyd. My work is done.", "As is mine, said Masson. Except the conclusion, which I will write in Paris.", "And what is that? said Lloyd. Your conclusion.", "That the English are deeply intolerant of the Irish language.", "Lloyd laughed.", "We hardly need a book to tell us that.", "That the English have done their best to portray Irish as the language of the poor, of the stupid.", "Lloyd shrugged.", "It\u2019s not very original thinking, is it? It needs to be said.", "It has been said.", "It needs to be said again.", "Lloyd returned the brush to the lean-to, setting it down beside the shovel encrusted with cement. He stopped as he passed Masson on the way back", "to his cottage.", "I finished that work, he said. Do you want to see it? The big canvas?", "Yes.", "Very much.", "Masson followed Lloyd into the studio. He stood in front of the canvas. He nodded, slowly.", "It\u2019s very, very good, Lloyd. Better than I had expected. A compliment.", "Masson laughed.", "They do happen. Sometimes. I\u2019ll take it, said Lloyd.", "But it\u2019s derivative, said Masson.", "Lloyd shook his head.", "It\u2019s a reinterpretation, yes, but not derivative. Maybe, said Masson. That\u2019s for others to decide.", "Lloyd nodded.", "I agree.", "It will garner a lot of attention for you, Lloyd.", "That\u2019s the hope. For the island too. Turn it into a tourist spot for them.", "What? said Masson. The Tahiti of the northern hemisphere? Lloyd shrugged.", "Why not?", "It would destroy this place, said Masson. Annihilate the language. It\u2019ll bring money, said Lloyd. An income other than fishing.", "The language won\u2019t survive that. That\u2019s not my concern, said Lloyd. It is mine.", "Masson walked the length of the canvas, stopping in front of Mair\u00e9ad.", "Have the islanders seen it?", "Lloyd shook his head.", "Only Mair\u00e9ad and James. That\u2019s probably for the best. Probably.", "Francis won\u2019t like it, said Masson. I gather that.", "The women won\u2019t either. Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "It\u2019ll be gone in the morning, said Lloyd.", "And that\u2019s it? You just whip the painting off the island, the islanders as you want them.", "You do the same thing, Masson.", "Masson shrugged.", "Peut-\u00eatre, he said. Maybe not.", "The Frenchman left and Lloyd levered the nails from the frame with his penknife. He stretched the canvas along the floor and rolled it, a square of clean dry canvas over James. He wrapped it again in the brown paper, tied it again with string.", "self-portrait: departure time", "Masson walked up the hill, through the village, to Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn\u2019s house. He tapped on the door, poured tea and sat opposite her. He lifted both her hands, kissed them.", "My last visit, he said. I\u2019m off tomorrow.", "She smiled at him.", "You are.", "Will you come down to the house for tea?", "She shook her head.", "Not with all you buckos.", "Masson laughed.", "It\u2019s too much for me, JP. All that squabbling. It\u2019s too much for me too, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "You never stopped, JP. All summer.", "It\u2019s a small island for a Frenchman to share with an Englishman. It seems that the world itself isn\u2019t big enough for the pair of you.", "He lifted her hands again and kissed them, right then left.", "It gives me a pain in the head listening to you both, JP. \u00c1ine can bring me my meal here, as she usually does.", "You\u2019re a wise woman, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "I\u2019ve been around long enough, JP. I\u2019ve seen most things by now.", "Masson nodded, slowly. But not his painting. The big canvas?", "The very one.", "Have you seen it, JP?", "I have, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. It\u2019s huge. And we\u2019re all in it.", "Me as well?", "You are. With your pipe.", "She shook her head.", "He said he was doing the cliffs. It\u2019s not the cliffs, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. No?", "It\u2019s the island. The islanders. He said he wouldn\u2019t do that.", "Mair\u00e9ad is in the middle of it. Posing for him. That\u2019s what she was up to.", "That\u2019s it.", "Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn drew heavily on her pipe.", "She\u2019s not wearing much, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. She\u2019s not?", "He shook his head.", "Only that green scarf she has. Around her hips. And that\u2019s it, JP?", "That\u2019s it, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "She nodded, slowly.", "She kept that very quiet.", "She did, said Masson. They both did.", "I knew there was something going on. Out there in that hut. I said that to you.", "You did, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. That very thing.", "She drew again on her pipe.", "Does Francis know? Masson shook his head.", "It\u2019s a big secret down there. Curtains and doors closed. He\u2019d go mad if he knew, JP.", "He would.", "He\u2019d put a stop to it.", "He would, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "His own sister-in-law. Liam\u2019s wife. You better not breathe a word of it, JP. Not a word.", "I won\u2019t, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn. Not a word.", "He kissed her on the cheek.", "I\u2019ll be on the slipway in the morning, she said. To wave you off.", "He kissed her on the other cheek. He smiled at her. He kissed each hand.", "I know I can rely on you, Bean U\u00ed Fhloinn.", "He closed the door and walked down the hill, whistling. He met James coming up.", "Are you off to say goodbye to your great-grandmother, S\u00e9amus? My name is James. And yes I am.", "They\u2019ll love S\u00e9amus in London. It\u2019s a great Irish name. They\u2019ll be happy enough with James, JP.", "Masson packed until it was time for the evening meal. Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill set plates in front of them, fuller than usual. The largest portion went to James. She ruffled his hair.", "A fine last meal, James, said Miche\u00e1l. The last time I\u2019ll eat rabbit, said James.", "They ate, silence along the table until Miche\u00e1l spoke.", "It\u2019ll be winter soon enough, he said. Another month, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "That\u2019s early, said Lloyd.", "Earlier here than other places, said Miche\u00e1l. What\u2019s it like here in winter? said Lloyd.", "Miche\u00e1l shook his head.", "Hard, he said. Nothing happens but the wind. Beidh s\u00e9 go h\u00e1lainn, said Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.", "They laughed.", "What did she say? said Lloyd.", "That it\u2019ll be wonderful, said Mair\u00e9ad. Lloyd laughed, Masson shook his head.", "That\u2019s very good English, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She smiled at him, the green scarf through her hair.", "Thank you, JP.", "You learnt a lot of English this summer, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She hesitated, but continued in English.", "I have, JP.", "I\u2019m sad about that, he said.", "She shrugged.", "James is going, JP. And?", "Caithfidh m\u00e9 B\u00e9arla a labhairt. I have to speak in English.", "Caillfidhear do theangaidh, said Masson.", "She closed her eyes.", "Your language will be lost, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She shook her head.", "It\u2019s me that will be lost, JP.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill cleared the dishes. She placed an apple tart on the table. And a bowl of cream. Mair\u00e9ad poured tea.", "We\u2019ll leave at eight tomorrow, said Miche\u00e1l. Get you over in time for the bus.", "Breakfast at seven, said Mair\u00e9ad.", "Masson stared at her. She laughed.", "Ar an seacht a chlog, JP.", "Miche\u00e1l and Francis left to smoke, to stand at the village wall. Masson resumed his packing and Lloyd walked down towards the cove. James followed him.", "I want to see it one last time, James. You\u2019ll see it in the morning, Mr Lloyd. It\u2019ll be busy then.", "It will.", "Lloyd walked ahead of him, down the narrow path.", "What about the canvas, Mr Lloyd? What about it?", "We need to take it off the frame. I\u2019ve done that. It\u2019s ready to go.", "Lloyd turned right into the ruins of the first village. James followed. Lloyd sat on a pile of rubble.", "You\u2019re on the Protestant school, said James. What? On this island?", "James nodded.", "There was a Protestant school and a Catholic school. That\u2019s unbelievable, James. A place this size.", "During the famine. You got soup if you went to the Protestant school. If you were in the Catholic school?", "Nothing.", "Lloyd shook his head.", "We weren\u2019t very nice, were we? You were not.", "But that\u2019s the past, James. It\u2019s different now.", "James picked paint off his hands.", "I hope so, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd looked at the sea, at the sky, at the birds swirling over the water, one last feed before night.", "It\u2019s a beautiful place, he said. It\u2019ll be hard to leave. No, it won\u2019t, said James.", "James peeled a strip of red paint from his left thumb and dropped it to the ground.", "It\u2019ll be very easy, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd rubbed his hands along his thighs, flattening the corduroy of his trousers.", "About that, James. About what, Mr Lloyd?", "I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s such a good time for you to be coming to London.", "James closed his eyes.", "I knew this was coming. What?", "Has Francis been talking to you?", "Lloyd shook his head.", "No. I\u2019ve been thinking about this.", "James peeled paint from his left hand. Sky blue.", "Thinking about what, Mr Lloyd?", "It\u2019s not a good idea for you to come with me. Not now.", "James dug his nails into his skin.", "And why\u2019s that, Mr Lloyd?", "Given everything that has been going on. Mountbatten, the soldiers, it\u2019s not a good time.", "Is that right, Mr Lloyd?", "It\u2019s not a safe time for you, James. Nobody will notice me, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd shrugged.", "It\u2019s not a safe time to be a young Irish man in London.", "James closed his eyes.", "You have to take me, Mr Lloyd. Let me do this.", "Lloyd shook his head.", "I\u2019m sorry, James. I can\u2019t.", "He opened his eyes.", "You can\u2019t just leave me here, Mr Lloyd. Start me off as an artist and then abandon me.", "I have no choice.", "James laughed. Scoffed.", "You do, Mr Lloyd. You have so many choices.", "You should go to Dublin, James. Go to art school there.", "James shook his head, slowly.", "Why didn\u2019t I think of that, Mr Lloyd?", "Lloyd nodded.", "It\u2019s not a bad idea, James.", "James spoke very slowly, enunciating each word.", "I don\u2019t know anybody in Dublin, Mr Lloyd. You\u2019ll get to know people.", "I don\u2019t have any money to go to Dublin, Mr Lloyd.", "Lloyd stood up.", "I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not working out for you at the moment, James, but it\u2019s beyond my control.", "Lloyd started back up the path.", "What about the exhibition, Mr Lloyd? What about it?", "Will I still be in the exhibition? Lloyd stopped and turned around.", "Yes, of course, James.", "So people will come and see my work. They will, James.", "Maybe teachers from the art school? Definitely.", "They might see my work and still take me in their school. That could happen, James.", "Lloyd resumed walking. James shouted after him.", "You don\u2019t mean a word of it, do you, Mr Lloyd?", "Lloyd waved, but did not turn around.", "I will do my best, James.", "James turned from him and stared at the sea, my father\u2019s grave, the fisherman\u2019s grave. He stood up and clambered along the cliff and out across the island, away from Lloyd, away from the village, from his", "mother who was in the back kitchen, cleaning after the evening meal, drying dishes, wiping down the sink.", "Francis stood in the doorway.", "How\u2019s it going there, Mair\u00e9ad? Grand, Francis.", "He nodded.", "What do you want? she said.", "He stepped towards her. Close to her.", "Jesus, Francis, back off.", "You didn\u2019t say that to Mr Lloyd. What are you on about?", "When he was painting you. When you were taking your clothes off for him.", "She walked around him and returned to the sink.", "How do you know about that, Francis?", "There are no secrets here, Mair\u00e9ad. You know that.", "She shrugged.", "So now you know, she said.", "We don\u2019t approve of what you\u2019re doing, he said.", "She laughed.", "Who\u2019s this \u2018we\u2019, Francis?", "We\u2019ve had a meeting. And I\u2019ve been sent in to talk to you. She resumed wiping the sink.", "So, she said. Talk.", "As I said, we don\u2019t approve of what you\u2019ve been doing. I need a list of names, she said. Of this \u2018we\u2019.", "You\u2019re out of line, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She walked around him and picked up the sweeping brush.", "Are you done now, Francis?", "She began to sweep the floor. He snatched the brush from her.", "As I said, you\u2019re out of line, Mair\u00e9ad.", "She shrugged.", "What line is that?", "My line.", "She laughed.", "What I do has nothing to do with you, Francis. It\u2019s everything to do with me.", "She sighed and moved towards the door. He blocked her path with the sweeping brush.", "You\u2019re my sister-in-law. Liam\u2019s wife.", "As I said, Francis, what I do has nothing to do with you.", "He flicked his fingers at her face.", "Stop it, Francis.", "We tolerated your bit of summer fun with the Frenchman, Mair\u00e9ad. Again, none of your business, Francis.", "Your bit of widow fun.", "He flicked at her face again.", "But this is too much, Mair\u00e9ad. Posing naked for an Englishman. Nothing to do with you, Francis. None of your business.", "She lifted the sweeping brush. He blocked her with his arm.", "It is my business, Mair\u00e9ad. Have you even seen it, Francis? What?", "The painting, Francis. Have you even seen the painting? I don\u2019t need to, Mair\u00e9ad.", "It\u2019s a work of art, Francis. And?", "I\u2019m in a work of art.", "He shook his head.", "You\u2019re Liam\u2019s wife.", "And?", "I\u2019m Liam\u2019s brother. And?", "Liam\u2019s wife is not taking her clothes off for an Englishman. She laughed.", "She can fuck a Frenchman but not take her clothes off for an Englishman. Is that it, Francis?", "You\u2019re a slut, Mair\u00e9ad. An English-speaking slut.", "She laughed again.", "Which is worse in your mind, Francis? Fucking a Frenchman or speaking English with an Englishman?", "Liam was too good for you, Mair\u00e9ad. We all said that.", "She shook her head.", "Don\u2019t you dare, Francis. You know nothing about Liam.", "He was my brother.", "She snorted.", "He thought you were a fucking idiot, Francis.", "He yanked at the scarf in her hair.", "Slut, he said.", "She put her hand on the scarf, stopping its fall.", "You\u2019d be happy enough if I was your slut, Francis Gillan.", "Her mother arrived then, into the kitchen. Mair\u00e9ad sighed and moved towards her.", "You can back away now, Francis. Leave me alone.", "He laughed.", "Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill stepped into the doorway of the back kitchen, blocking the evening light.", "We won\u2019t have it, Mair\u00e9ad. Have what, Mam?", "You. Like this. It\u2019s too much, Mair\u00e9ad.", "In the morning, at seven, James brought breakfast to Lloyd. He set it on the table. Lloyd sat down.", "Do you want some tea, James?", "James shook his head.", "No, thank you, Mr Lloyd.", "That\u2019s a shame, James. I\u2019d like us to have a last cup of tea together. Not to be, Mr Lloyd.", "James rolled back his shoulders and put his two hands in his pockets. He stared at the Englishman.", "We had a deal, Mr Lloyd. An arrangement. Circumstances change, James.", "Only if you let them, Mr Lloyd. If you want them to.", "James returned to the kitchen to eat breakfast, at the table on his own with Masson, his grandmother at the fire, his mother still in bed.", "Are you ready for the big trip, James? I\u2019m not going.", "Why not? You\u2019re packed, aren\u2019t you?", "I\u2019ll go across later. When the teachers call me to the art school.", "Masson nodded.", "I\u2019m sorry, James.", "James closed his eyes.", "I\u2019ll see you then in the spring, James, when I come back with the camera crews.", "James shook his head, his eyes still closed. No, he said. I\u2019ll be gone by the spring. Not too long to wait then, James.", "Not long, JP.", "He finished his porridge, drank his tea and walked away from the village, out along the island\u2019s edge, watching from the cliff as Lloyd moved down the path to the cove, carrying the rolled-up canvas with Miche\u00e1l, one in front of the other. Masson followed with his recorder, Francis and the old men in their wake with the suitcases, mahogany chest and easel. James stuffed his hands deeper into his pockets.", "They rowed out in three currachs to Miche\u00e1l\u2019s boat. Lloyd climbed on board and sat alone with his canvas perched on the seat, away from the watery traces of heifer manure swirling still around the floor of the boat. Masson sat near Francis who was pulling ropes into the stern.", "The old men in the currachs waved them on. Miche\u00e1l started the engine and turned the boat away from the island, towards the mainland, the noise of their leaving drowning out the gulls and terns squawking in the cove.", "The islanders rowed back to the slipway, lifted the currachs from the water and carried them over their heads, out of the cove. They set them down at the top of the slipway and walked up the hill towards the village, backs stooped, legs buckled.", "James remained on the edge, watching until Miche\u00e1l\u2019s boat disappeared from view. He walked back along the clifftop to the cottage and into the studio, into the lingering smell of paint, linseed oil, charcoal and white spirits. He looked around the emptied room, at the canvas frame scattered in fragments across the floor, at the six paintings for the exhibition in London, bound in cardboard and white string, waiting still by the door, as he had left them, as Lloyd had left them.", "Gabriel Wiggins is washing dishes in the kitchen of his West Belfast home shortly before midnight on Wednesday, September 12th. He is fifty-six years old, Catholic, and a father to fourteen children.", "Someone knocks on the front door. He turns on the hall light, but quickly turns it off again. He doesn\u2019t open the door. The UVF gunman shoots through the glass, killing Gabriel Wiggins, an unemployed gardener."]
